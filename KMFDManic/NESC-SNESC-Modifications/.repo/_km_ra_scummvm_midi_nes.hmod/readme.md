This module will add support for pseudo NES sound swapping, via Midi!

Enjoy your ScummVM games, such as Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Day of the Tentacle,
and many more...in an entirely new light, with a uniquely different 8-bit sound quality!  ScummVM, circa NES style, yay:)

MUNT is an MT-32 Emulator for ScummVM.  Unfortunately, on the Mini Classics, it is not currently functional.  So,
nava and myself devised a workaround, wherein we utilized Midi to swap out sound for pseudo MT-32 & NES SoundFonts!

Whichever of the two RetroArch ScummVM Midi HMODs is installed "last" will take precedence over the former.  

Reinstalling RetroArch Xtreme will revert to "standard" ScummVM sound.  You can, alternately, go into ScummVM 
Settings, while a game is currently loaded within the Core...and, select either/or, of whichever is installed.
You can, additionally, install the RetroArch ScummVM Default Sound HMOD to revert to a per norm situation.
