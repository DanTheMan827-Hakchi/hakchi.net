Module adds support for Custom PSP fonts, 
including the "originals" that came with the
system!  For legal reasons, these cannot be
included!

Simply copy the pertinent ltn0.pgf you choose to 
use into the root font folder, and make sure to
install this HMOD after PPSSPP Core!  To revert 
fonts, uninstall then reinstall PPSSPP Core.  Or, 
you can reinstall this specific HMOD, pre-ltn0.pgf
replacement.
