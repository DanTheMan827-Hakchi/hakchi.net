**What is OpenBOR?**

Beats of Rage is an open-source 2D customisable video game engine designed by Senile Team and inspired by
Sega's classic Streets of Rage series of beat'em up games. It was initially released as a video game tribute
for Streets of Rage 2 with characters from The King of Fighters.

**Development and release**

Beats of Rage took nine months to develop.[1][2] The game was then modded and ported to other systems, resulting
in increased popularity. More than a million copies of the game were downloaded.[1]

Beats of Rage was first made available for DOS in November 2003.[3] Despite only word-of-mouth advertising, the 
game quickly gained popularity, taking down mirror hosts such as Dreamcast-Scene only 24 hours after agreeing to host it.[4][5]

As the game was open source, it was ported to Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. It has continued to receive ports, as it is
available on contemporary systems including Wii and PlayStation Portable as well as several other platforms.

For a homebrew game, Beats of Rage received significant mainstream media attention, being highlighted in gaming 
magazine G4.[6] The game was also featured in printed media such as XboxGamer.[7]
