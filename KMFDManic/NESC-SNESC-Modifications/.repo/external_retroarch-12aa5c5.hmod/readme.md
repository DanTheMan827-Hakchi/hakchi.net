**Warning** May cause instability and/or corruption on improper shut-downs.  For Advanced Users ONLY!

This mod will move /etc/libretro to the attached external usb drive at hakchi/libretro, it will then use that location for all retroarch cores instead of the internal nand memory.

## Uninstall
During uninstall, the libretro directory on the USB drive will replace the one on nand if there is enough available free space.
