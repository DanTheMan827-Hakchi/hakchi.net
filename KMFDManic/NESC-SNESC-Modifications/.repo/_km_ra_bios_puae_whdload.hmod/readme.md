**This HMOD will allow Direct WHDLoad Support for P-UAE Xtreme Core!**

**Prerequisite BIOS: Kickstart BIOS: kick34005.A500, kick40063.A600, kick40068.A1200, installed via RA BIOS Master Module**

**What is WHDLoad?**

WHDLoad is an entirely software-based system designed to allow users to quickly and easy launch floppy-based games and demos and have them accurately run on the entire range of Amiga hardware. It was originally released in 1996 to address the issue of games running improperly or not at all on more recent Amiga systems featuring more powerful MC680x0 CPUs, the more advanced ECS and AGA custom chipsets, and newer versions of AmigaDOS.

WHDLoad works like this: Once installed, the user chooses a title from the lengthy (and growing) list of supported software and provides the original floppies for it. The system reads the floppies and writes out disk image files to the hard disk and effectively patches them so that they run on the local system just as they would on their original, target spec Amiga.

- Perfect execution — at least — of games and demos regardless of the local platform’s hardware specifications.
- In some cases, performance is improved beyond the original title running on its target platform (e.g., smoother framerate, menus adjusted, known bugs fixed, etc.).
- Customizations can be made and chosen via soft-switch, where provided by the author of the title’s importer patches (e.g., unlimited lives, unlimited firepower, etc.).
- Nearly instantaneous loading through the Amiga’s Workbench GUI, thanks to hard drive speed and the ability to pre-load disk image data as memory permits.
- When finished playing, a tap to the exit-key perfectly restores the Amiga to its previous state — no reboot needed.
- Ability to run certain games and demos within emulators such as UAE, that otherwise would not run easily or at all.
