**If you have difficulty with THIS version of Xtreme Virtual Ram, use the ALT one!  Be sure to uninstall this one, first!
**This Module absolutely requires USB or SD for installation, and creates a 512 MB Swap File on such to minimize game and memory leak crashing!**
**Recommended Ext4 Format for most optimal usage, followed respectively by NTFS, then Fat32!**

Some benefits to Xtreme Virtual Ram include:

- N64 Games, such as Star Fox 64 will easily get past the 2nd stage+ choke points, where the game ALWAYS runs out of memory!
- N64 Games, generally, have variable amounts of memory leakage.  Some crash in 40 minutes, others in 14 hours.  This increases those times, exponentially!  
- Additionally, you can insta-clear memory leaks on ANY N64 Game by going into RetroArch Settings, Video, Toggle Force-disable sRGB FBO On/Off
- Force-disable sRGB FBO On/Off also works for a number of other Cores!  But, for some Dreamcast Games, you must Toggle twice, or will get graphical glitches!
- Force-disable sRGB FBO On/Off usage on Cores that don't support it, will simply close content on usage of such
- PSP Games, such as God of Wars...that were impossible to run, are actually playable now...especially if you use the exploit to disable audio driver temporarily!
- To disable Audio Driver, without content loaded, go into RetroArch Settings, Audio, Toggle Audio Driver Off.  Exit RetroArch, Reenter, to take effect.  
- Atomiswave/Naomi Games with either/or Dreamcast Core, typically crash...depending on cumulative and overall power draw/usage!  Not anymore:)
- Doom SIGIL, the .wad music sample version, will actually work with the additional memory
- MAME 2003 Xtreme Samples, particularly ones over 80MB, such as Street Fighter II, will no longer crash on memory unload!
