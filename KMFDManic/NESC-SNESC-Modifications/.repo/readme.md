 The list of people that I have had the absolute pleasure of dealing and collaborating with over the years, as far as Libretro, the Mini Classics Scene, Nintendo Power and other various projects, as well as YouTube followers and subscribers, has grown so exponentially...that it would now practically take a book to detail them all.  So, I will now say, "I can't thank you enough!  You all simply make each day better than the last!"

Hello Everyone, this is a minor Update to Hot Fix a few things that were brought to my attention by some of you, regarding latest Release!  As always, I greatly appreciate any and all feedback, especially when it helps get things fixed up faster!  

Latest WandaVision, quite interesting.  I sorta peeked a little into the "Comic Arc" that the series is based on.  And, hot damned, it is gonna be potentially a crazy trip!  Otherwise, I am a fan of Walton Goggins of Shield, Justified fame.  I decided to give his "sitcom" show, Unicorn, a go.  And, despite some bad IMDB reviews, he still carries the show!  I have always enjoyed goofy sitcoms, in general.  Going way back to the earliest days of Simpsons, I liked shows like Herman's Head and Get a Life!  Get a Life, particularly, had some insanely oddball plotlines, such as the main character, a 30ish year old paperboy, who still lives at home with his parents...finding an Alien.  And, he tries to "relive" the awesomeness of ET with said Alien.  But, things get a tad bit out of hand!  Try looking up a clip of Get a Life to see just what I mean!  Also, huge fan of Sledge Hammer (parody of Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry movies!).  In any case, a few bullet points relative to this Hot Fix Update!!!

- Decompression Fix for some Cores on MD/SNES/NES!
- DraStic Fixed Up further for MD Mini!
- Sonic Deconstructed 1, 2, CD Information Updated!
- WIP!

**Decompression Fix for some Cores on MD/SNES/NES!**

Some of you who have been with us since the earlier NES Classic days, pre USB-HOST, would remember how annoying it was to contend with limited space on NAND internal flash memory!  Madmonkey made it possible for us to compress Cores down to 75 percent smaller in size.  These currently decompress upon active usage, leaving you with way more NAND space!  I got a little feedback that some Cores were "failing to be opened", not loading content.  So, I did some fix ups, and am reposting these, such as Gambatte, CPS1, CPS2, Stella.  So, if you ran into any issues, please redownload the problem Cores from Hakchi, Modules, KMFD Mod Hub, and then reinstall via Modules Tab!  Note: I have retained the dates for ALL Cores as 02-24-21, to keep things aligned and uniform.  You will see the MOTD say 02-28-21 in Mod Hub, to signify things are Updated, though!

Thanks DrGreenThumbNZL, ROMEO, NESminiling0618, anyone else, for the heads up!  Things operate a little differently between MD/SNES/NES/PSC, as far as the actual execution, loading of content, decompression of Cores.  If any of you still have difficulty with any specific Core, be sure to let me know.  And, I will see what I can do!  Sometimes, I have to build things differently, so they function properly on any given Mini Classic.  IE: PPSSPP Legacy works on SNES/NES Classics Only.  BUT, not MD/PSC!  But, Xtreme and Xtreme Amped work on ALL 4:)  There are "exploit" workarounds for this, such as Switching to ALT firmwares, such as running SNES on NES!  I will do a Video Tutorial on HOW to do this when I get a chance!  Unfortunately, due to the logistics of things, a few select Cores may simply not function on 1 or more of whichever Minis.  But, I will do what I can to make them as cross compatible as possible!  Think of it like this, some Minis come with metaphorical training wheels, so you don't crash on certain Cores!  Others, don't, so crashing is more likely!  Not a whole lot different than the OverClock scenario not working for all Minis!  No matter the case, I will get a video up about the firmware switching, soon:)  And, I will cover a few of the peskier Cores, which might best benefit from swapping out!

**DraStic Fixed Up further for MD Mini!**

DraStic Build for MD/SNES/NES is fixed up to appropriately switch between MD AND SNES/NES, now.  Thanks for being patient.  And thanks, bslenul for helping make this possible, so I didn't have to do two friggin' builds!  Scroll down to the "DraStic Controls Fixed Up For MD Mini!" section from Yesterday's Notes to read more about this Addition!

**Sonic Deconstructed 1, 2, CD Information Updated!**

Sonic 1, 2, CD were originally done by Sega, and then remade and fixed up by Christan Whitehead!  He did a fantastical job with all 3, and truly showed his love letter to the Sonic Legacy!  In more recent times, RubberDuckyCooly decompiled these games, so that we COULD run them on other Platforms, such as the Mini Classics.  And, RMGRich did a huge job with this endeavor, too!  And, thanks DanTheMan827 for helping with the tricky porting of these TO the Mini Classics, MD/SNES/NES, for now!

To run these, simply download from Mod Hub, Games Tab, whichever game, then navigate to the CLV they are in.  With whichever Steam/Android version you have, you will need to either "file browse" for Steam/open apk with 7zip on Android.  Extract the Data.rsdk and videos folder, if applicable.  Then, simply copy and paste into said CLV, rinse and repeat for each game!  Synch/Export, enjoy some Sonic Mania awesomeness!  I still need to get that game for PS4!

**HOME Button Mapping on Controllers for RetroArch!**

Some of you may find your home button doesn't get you home to main menu, on your Mini Classics.  You can easily program a Quit Button, by opening up RetroArch, then input, hot key binds, quit retroarch, choose what you'd like for home, apply!  Personal thanks to DR1001 for helping test MD Mini Home Button manipulation.  As of the Next Release, may put a few "Home Button" defaults to help account for some 8BITDO controllers, and such, so things are automatic!  For now, however, doing it this manual way works quite nicely!

**WIP!**

I will be fixing up several more Cores, and also having a High Definition Audio Geared Setup, which still handles performance/speed, considerably well.  This will benefit the usage of the Amazing Full on Custom CD Soundtracks for MAME, complete with mindblowing Stereo Audiophile Awesomeness!  Thanks again gpstar81, bigbluefrontend, grant2258, arcadez2003, for all of your help and efforts with anything MAME related!

I will be doing more Xtreme Stuff with SNES, MD, PSX, and so on!  Another HD PCSX Core will make the cut, Next Release, and another Genesis Xtreme GX, and of course, an SNES Xtreme of some proportions or another!  I will try to get a handle on updating Saturn/Dreamcast, some more, too, if feasible and safe enough to, without causing issues for the Minis.  There are still a few bugs to work out with both, as far as their updated execution on the Mini Classics!  

In any case, thanks so much, everyone...Enjoy the Hot Fixes, the overall Update, and tune into my YouTube to catch up more on what will go into the Next Release, and what is already in THIS one:)  Talk soon, on Reddit, Discord, YouTube, and so on!

KM!

**Hakchi2 CE HAS been updated to 3.9.0!**

 You can read about the Updated Changes, including -30 MB install error, run out of space, bug fix, access denied fix, hyphens no longer renamed to underscores (breaks MSU-1 Games!), and the best addition of all...Import your Game Library FROM the Mini or USB!  DanTheMan827 did a fantastic job going Beast Mode Activate with this incredible Update!  You can see me use it in the DOSBox Pure Tutorial I just posted!  Thanks again, Dan!

Well, we are finally here for the Next Release, with many fun things to go out!  Previous Release Notes from 2017-2020 have been moved into Xtras/Releases in Txt/Doc format, for those of you would like to peruse them!  In any case, let's get moving forward with the Notes for THIS particular Release!  And, thank you all so incredibly much for being so utterly patient!  And, thanks all of you that I talk to on a daily basis, via Reddit, Discord, YouTube!  You make my days much better!  I will do what I can to respond to each and every message that escaped me:)  And, be sure to check out my YouTube Videos, and comment, etc, so I can better establish an accord to get more and more things accounted for and fixed up, NEXT Update:)  Note: there are simply TOO many things updated and added to go into specific detail about each and every one of them.  You will find a few surprises, along the way, as you test the New Release out!  And, I will throw up more videos, showcasing some of the Bullet Points that I didn't add to these Notes!  And, even more fun stuff, already WIP for NEXT Update!

Truly upstanding and devoted and awesome guy!), BlackSunshine (has helped test the latest additions I have been adding, for close to 200+ hours, through the course of the last several months!  Helped out with mapping of entire N64 Collection for use on D-Pad!), MadFranko008 (one of the most attentive to detail individuals I could ever hope for, and doesn't ever hold back from critique, which truly helps make each Release even more Bad-Ass!  Helped on the mappers, along with BlackSunshine!)  And, of course, thanks, as always Genderbent!  I will help get things in order, so you can put out a kick-ass RetroBoot Release with my latest additions, soon!  And, finally, thanks EVERYONE else who chats it up with me via Reddit, Discord, YouTube, on a near daily basis!  Thanks so much for being there!  You make the Scene a much better place!  Enjoy The Release!  Moving On:)

**TV & Movie Recommends!**

Since I have generally maintained a Blog like presence when doing The Releases, might as well recommend some fun movies and/or TV shows I have had the pleasure of watching in recent times, since the Last Update!

Right off the bat, one particular movie, I had been looking forward to for awhile...PG Psycho Goreman, is a very fun flick!  Without spoiling too much, it is essentially like Wishmaster crossed with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.  A Thanos like warlord, who has decimated entire civilizations, is inexplicably under the control of a very precocious teenage girl and her brother!  It truly feels like something you'd see in the late 1980's, early 1990's.  And, some of the practical and animated effects are downright cool and funny at the same time!  Just watch the trailer, for yourself, to get a little gist of the style of movie it is!

Freaky, with Vince Vaughn, awesome "Freaky Friday" style film, with a Serial Killer swapping places with a teenage girl.  Vince is always fun to watch in about everything he is in.  I especially loved "Brawl in Cell Block 99".  It is a rarity, as critics have raved about the movie quite a bit.  And, absolutely violent as hell movies do not typically get the best of reviews!  It starts out like your normal crime drama.  But, within the first hour, you definitely see it is anything but!  It almost verges on Mortal Kombat violence, by the time it is in full swing!

And, obviously, if you check out my YouTube videos, you will hear me chat about various movies and TV shows I have been watching, too!  I would usually watch horror movies, first and foremost.  Then, sci fi, comedy and action, drama, kids, cartoons.  I just randomly decided to try out a Disney Channel show called Secrets of Sulphur Springs, and found it to be fairly interesting.  It revolves around a man who moves his family back home to reopen a hotel that had closed many years back.  A dark history surrounds this hotel, as a young girl inexplicably disappeared (possibly murdered or killed in some malicious fashion).  Her ghost apparently now haunts said hotel.  Minor Spoiler alert...I am a huge time travel fan...Anything dealing with time travel is always fascinating for me.  I had no clue this would involve a time traveling scenario, which made it even more appealing to me.  

Palm Springs was another super fun Time Travel movie I watched recently on Hulu.  Well worth a watch, very very good!  And, yet another one popped up on Amazon Prime, called The Map of Tiny Perfect Things.  I still need to give this one a go!  I usually give about any Time Travel Movie/Show/Game a shot!

Lastly, speaking of time travel movies, one of my favorites would easily be "The Final Countdown" with Kirk Douglas.  A crew on a ship somehow time travels back to right before the Pearl Harbor attack.  They have to decide upon the moral implications of preventing the disaster from ever occurring...And, what consequences might affect the "new" future, if they do so!  And, final time travel reference...for now...Loved the show Continuum!!!  Fun fun show!

I initially saw the trailer for Monster Hunter, and thought..."no way I am gonna care for this turd".  But, I gave it a chance, and found it pretty fun.  Didn't realize that Tony Jaa, one of my favorite martial artist actors from "The Protector" (Guy kicks a ton of ass when his elephant friend gets (kidnapped proper word!?:)  Like Children of Men, it has a very awesome extended action scene, which looks like it was possibly done in one single take!  1917 and Birdman took this gimmick to the next level, with both movies seeming like one single scene!  A few other movies utilized this, as well.  But, the aforementioned ones, especially garnered my interest the most!
 
Lastly, WandaVision!  I thought this would be goofy and silly, too!  I tried to start watching it, like 3 times.  I then stopped, thinking, lame!  But, I tried again, and ended up appreciating what they were trying to do with it!  Marvel Phase 3 was awesome.  And, 4 should be quite good, especially with the newly added variables to the mix!  Ironically, enough, in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, Marvel Movie properties simply did not do as well, which is why many of the characters were sold to other companies, such as Fox and Sony, etc!  Just imagine how epic proportioned Phase 4 is gonna end up, once it truly gets rolling!  In any case, here we go, off to the Mod Races!

**This is the Big One Elizabeth!**

Minor Spoiler Alert...Each episode of WandaVision kinda plays tribute to various sitcoms throughout the last several decades.  One that I really enjoyed was Sanford and Son!  And, the tagline of this section of the Release is a tribute to the amazing Red Foxx!  Everything I have ever seen him in has been fun, including Harlem Nights!  

In any case, The Big One refers, in this modus operandi, is to establish much better performance/speed for N64 Games, in general!

**Mo Mods! Mo Problems!**

As the Releases progress, so do the sheer amount of Cores and Modifications that go out, as well!  Some of these will be moved to different tabs, to try to keep things a little easier to handle for the average end user.  Moving forward, the more experimental, less stable stuff will mostly be in the KMFD Xtreme Tab, including stuff like RetroArch Xtreme Amped, Xtreme Virtual Ram, etc!  And, this time, due to how effectively different Xtreme Virtual Ram can be, depending on whomever's particular designated setup, at any given time...There will be an ALT version, for those who have difficulty with the Main one!  If Main one doesn't work properly for you (kind of like how overclocking doesn't work for all systems!), uninstall, and use the ALT one.  The ALT one uses combination of Swap File on USB to allow more memory usage, as well as direct kernel implementation, furthermore optimized for better grace, speed, performance, with N64, Dreamcast, SNES, etc! 

**Fan Updated Sonic the Hedgehog Games Ported to MD/SNES/NES!**

Thanks DanTheMan827, Christian Whitehead, and ALL else involved in this process!  We can now run Android/Steam versions of Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, and CD on our MD/SNES/NES Classics!  These are pretty insanely awesome.  Imagine, being able to spin dash in Sonic 1, and also play as Knuckles!  You can traverse levels in ways you never imagined before!  So many many differences between the originals!  You WILL need to drop the assets into the CLV Folder, once downloaded.  Then, Synch/Export, to enjoy them:)  Needed Assets also in ReadMe, while displayed in hakchi!  You can see me doing video demonstrations of all 3 of these, recently, on my YouTube Channel!

**Sega Genesis WIDESCREEN Support!**

Many of you are purists, and absolutely despise any deviation from the original 4:3 aspect ratio these games were in!  But, those of you who can look past that, can enjoy one of the most amazing gimmicks to ever enter our Mini Classics...MD Games with awesome, mind blowingly awesome, in fact...Widescreen Support!  I did a video showcasing several of these.  You truly cannot go wrong, playing stuff like Streets of Rage 1, in widescreen!  Even Arcade Game wise, there are quite a limited amount of them that offer such great widescreen shenanigans!  Rastan III, Ninja Warriors, Darius, a select other number of others!  They truly stand out, when you DO run into them!  Not ALL games will function properly with the Widescreen Core.  Several games will have glitches, like in the video I did!  But, it is incredibly fun testing them out to see which benefit from this addition!  And, things will be updated to support even more, in future Updates!  There are more nuances to adjust to, when utilizing THIS implementation, of which...I will showcase further in videos!

Thanks to all involved with Libretro, heyjoeway, ekeeke, ds22x, and anyone else I have had the pleasure of dealing with for this and any other Release:)

**DOSBox Pure! DOS has never been better!**

Going back to the earlier NES Classic days, one of the very first problems we had was inability to play PC oriented Cores, due to having no keyboard!  So, I pushed hard for keyboard to controller mapping.  I did a "mock up" video, showing how useful and practical such an addition would be.  I got the video to the right people in Libretro.  And, it ended up becoming a reality, soon after.  And, now, a few years later, nearly EVERY PC related Core on the Mini Classics has the keyboard to mapping function, including the newest one, DOSBox Pure!  It just has to be experienced to see how friggin' fantastic it is!  It sure as hell beats the old days of pulling up a virtual onscreen keyboard, to tap the space bar, JUST so I can do the special attack in Turrican for Commodore 64!  Geeze, that literally sucked!  

DOS, alone, already has enough of a learning curve.  But, now, with the combination of keyboard to controller mapping, and practicality to cover nearly every instance one can imagine running into DOSBox wise, we are in very very good hands, moving forward, with this Core!  And, thanks so much to all who have worked on DOS, EVER!  And, thank you, schellingb and the rest of the Team!

I did a Tutorial Video on this.  Any games that you have trouble running, be sure to let me know!  Been there, done that:)  Years ago!

**Nintendo 64 Goes To Ludicrous Proportions!**

There was this running joke, where a certain someone posted a picture of a game that could not POSSIBLY EVER run on any of the Mini Classics.  And, this is indirectly what helped inspire me to improve N64 Emulation a bit more for us.  Again, I strive for Performance/Speed versus Stability/Latency.  So, if you are allergic to a little bit of latency, you may wanna stick to the more stable N64 Cores, such as Parallel!  This is all about trying to go to more epic proportions, and better capably handle N64 games, in ways never quite seen before:)  

In the case of the game that won't ever work, Mario Sunshine, Game Cube!  It will NEVER EVER work on the MD/SNES/NES:)  After poking about, discovered that a Mario Sunshine hack, made by Kaze, using original game engine...in a beautiful way, to literally be a whole new game experience...existed!  But, it ran really awful on the Minis!  So, this was a base point for me.  If I could improve THIS CPU intensive game, then the sky was the limit for other games!

I also noticed that MANY were stuck using mediocre, plain controllers, without analog support.  So, when they go to play N64 Games, they obviously cannot run them well:)  So, myself, MadFranko008, and BlackSunshine have dumped dozens of hours into making the near entirely of the N64 Core Game Set run with strictly D Pad Support, with minimal of at least SNES controller!  More on this in the next section!

**Entire Suite of N64 Cores Fixed Up For MD/SNES/NES!**

Command Lines HAVE changed for the N64 Cores!  So, pay attention!  You can right click, select emulation Core, and designate the NEWER command lines via hakchi, then resynch/reexport!

Not only do we have the LudicrousN64 Xtreme Core.  This specific Core is optimized to run games in higher definition (640x480) than the standard (320x240) we have been accustomed to being stuck at for these lower spec Minis!  In fact, it is really the only N64 Core, for the time being (MD/SNES/NES, wise), to be able to even handle being HD.  I also fixed up GlupeN64 to have more reliable Saves and Performance and Speed.  Mupen64 Xtreme is exceptionally great for running games that do not run at all, or not as well on GlupeN64 Xtreme, LudicrousN64 Xtreme, and Parallel Xtreme.  Some of these include the recently "leaked", long lost "Dinosaur Planet: Star Fox (Adventures)" Game, as well as:

- 007: The World is Not Enough
- Animal Forest
- Chameleon Twist 2
- Conker's Bad Fur Day
- Gauntlet Dark Legacy
- Harvest Moon
- Jet Force Gemini
- Last Legion
- Mickey Speedway
- Pokemon Stadium 1 and 2
- Star Wars: Rogue Squadron
- Stunt Racer 64
- World Driver Championship
- Etc!

Obviously, loading a game that is not supported, will either crash back to main menu, or lock up your system!  So, stay away from games that are known to not work or are far too slow, such as Indiana Jones and NBA Hangtime.

**Entire Suite of N64 Cores Fixed Up For PSC! No More SRGB Toggle!**

Nintendo 64 has undergone a pretty massive overhaul for the Playstation Classic!  Most of the Cores are now optimized to run at higher definition (640x480).  The primary exceptions are the Mupen Xtreme Amped and OC Builds.  These must stay, for now, at 320x240 to avoid severe and horrendous conflicts!  But, GlupeN64, LudicrousN64, Parallel, Mupen Xtreme, are all at 640x480, and run quite nicely!  Some of the notes for the MD/SNES/NES description above this section, also apply here!  But, PSC gets an added bonus, the ability to run many games without worry or need of utilizing the pesky and troublesome and annoying SRGB Toggle Fix!  Typically, when playing a game, such as Killer Instinct...after a minute or so, the game would inexplicably become slow and freeze or crash!  You would have a small window of time to get into RetroArch Settings, Video, and Toggle the SRGB Option On or Off, let the screen refresh, then resume game to fix the game speed!  This can break up the immersion of about any game!  No More!  Now, you can run Killer Instinct and other such games, that previously had slowdown issues, with Mupen Xtreme Amped or Mupen Xtreme Amped OC.  And, SRGB Toggling will essentially be automatic.  When your game "should" slow down, it will auto clear that memory for ya, and be back in shape in a split moment or so:)  Dark Rift is another notorious example of a game that slows down awful! 

The suite of Mupen Xtreme Cores are aligned in such a way to cover as many bases as possible, due to the limitations of the PSC!  A game, such as World Driver Championship, would run best with Mupen Xtreme...But, if attempting to run it on Mupen Xtreme Amped or OC, it would slow down to a crawl...and, have severe graphical glitches!  Same with Star Fox: Dinosaur Planet Beta Leak.  It will run best with Mupen Xtreme.  In fact, I would strongly suggest you run MOST of the games you are going to run, via Mupen Xtreme, with mainly ones like Killer Instinct, Dark Rift, and so on...with Amped or OC!  OC, itself, is a more pronounced OverClock Build.  It can Super OverClock to 50!  I will showcase this execution more in videos!  The drawback is that it takes up to 10+ seconds to load games with the OC build!  So, the tier of order here would be Xtreme, Amped, then OC, as far as which to try with whichever games!  

If you try to load a game that does NOT work with one of these Cores, it can instantly freeze your system!  So, avoid loading games like Indiana Jones or Resident Evil 2, as they are quite likely to freeze your system!  Resident Evil 2 DOES work on Parallel.  But, it is too slow to truly be playable!  Yet another thing to look into fixing up, in the future!

**Nintendo 64 Non-Analog Mappers For Use With D-Pad!**

For MD/SNES/NES, you can grab the Mappers HMOD from KMFD Xtreme Tab!  For PSC, it will be in the PSC/AB/Folder!  With this installed, you will be able to go into RetroArch Settings, Quick Menu, Controls, and actively select a D-Pad (SNES Controller Schemed) setup, to run a vast majority of known, working N64 Titles!  Obviously, SOME games, such as the Wrestling Ones, MK Mythologies, etc, have no way to run on JUST an SNES controller.  You NEED L2+R2 for some of these!  But, the least used functions have been thrown onto L2+R2 for these instances!  You can also amend the mappers, and "resave" them!  Upon saving them, they will auto load on Next Game Load:)  And, feedback on improvements, can go into future Updates!  Note, because we dealt with 400+ of these, some may be imperfect or may need fixed up a little more!  But, feedback and your input will be most paramount into quickly whipping these mappers into better shape, as Updates progress!  ANALOGs are left intact.  So, if you still have Analog controllers, You will be able to use them!  

**MAME 2003 Xtreme/Plus Updated!**

Arcade Games are my lifeblood.  And, I have been in collaboration with many, over the last 20+ years, MAME, FBA/FBNEO wise!  Literally, the main reason I even got a computer to begin with, was for MAME!  Stuff like NES followed suit!  As did other emulators:)  Very early on, I took an interest in trying to get these games to run better on my lower spec Windows 98 computer!  And, that is where making changes to the coding, made a difference!  

With THIS Update, I added a few new things, such as more nuanced frame skipping ability (MAME 2003 Xtreme, ONLY, for now).  No longer choppy, like before!  So, putting it to 2, etc, will be far less pronounced, than in earlier Releases!  Also, the long lost classic Midway Arcade Power Up Baseball has been implemented!  This game is fantastic, and the NBA Jam of Baseball!  A few other fun additions added, as well.  You can pay attention to my recent MAME videos, to see how these play out.  

Thanks so much Arcadez2003, Grant2258, Wilstorm, Mahoneyt944, dinkc64, for your insight and support, as I have ported and coded in some these updates, as well as your own amazing efforts with MAME/FBNEO!  

One thing, especially, that will become more prominent with future Updates, will be auto calibrations (Next section, for more on these!), for games such as Carnevil, etc, wherein you can simply load a game up, and be locked and loaded, Contra Hard Corps style.  Simply play the game, no need to calibrate whatsoever.  With THIS Update, Cruisn USA is an example.  It will still run slow, of course.  But, you can at least see it auto calibrates!  Frame Skip with Xtreme helps run it a little better!  You can also use the LudicrousN64 Xtreme Core to run the N64 version, and change OverClock+TurboBoost values to your preference, for that and other such troublesome games!  Cruisn World works fine, Exotica, which never worked before, works awesome!

**MAME 2003 Xtreme Amped!**

One thing that has always been irritating, for those of you who have ever run "certain" Arcade Games...That would be having to worry about calibrating or initializing stubborn games!  Some games, such as Run 'n Gun, great Konami Basketball Game...would absolutely lock up and be unplayable, generating errors on the check sequence boot up!  BUT, in recent times, MAME 2003 Plus/Xtreme/Amped have all undergone some very nice overhauls regarding this annoyance.  MANY games will auto calibrate or initialize, making things far more optimal on the Mini Classics end, execution wise!  I did a demonstration of several of these!  But, a list of some you can now try include!:

- 2 on 2 Open Ice (Volume Fixes!
- Gaiapolis (Game properly initializes and no longer lags or freezes constantly!)
- Monster Maulers AND its Japan Version Kyukyoku Sentai Dadandarn (Same Fix Ups as Gaiapolis!)
- Mortal Kombat II (Loud Volume, finally!:)
- NBA Hang Time (Number of Players Increased, Other Fixes!)
- Night Slashers (Blood Mode Activate!)
- Rampage World Tour (Sound Fixes!)
- Revolution X (Controls auto calibrate, SOUND is loud!)
- Terminator 2 (Controls auto calibrate!)
- Violent Storm (Blood Mode Activate!)
- WWF Wrestlemania (Volume is Loud and finally able to be heard!)
- Many Others showcased in my MAME 2003 Xtreme Amped Video!  Will show more, soon!

**FBNEO System 32!**

You can now run System 32 Games with FBNEO (only for PSC, for now!)  Unfortunately, even the slightly better specs of PSC, over that of MD/SNES/NES, still aren't quite good enough to handle these games!  But, check out Holosseum as ONE game that does work decently!  Many others work, too, such as Spider-Man, Golden Axe 2: Death Adder, Jurassic Park, Alien 3, etc.  But, unfortunately, a bit too slow!  BUT, the good news is, these games already work fine, albeit with minor graphical glitches...in MAME 2003 Xtreme!  So, if you do want to play them, 2003 Xtreme may be the best route for you, for the time being!   

**DraStic Controls Fixed Up For MD Mini!**

Thanks darthtron64, for being the very first to bring this issue to my attention!  Amazing how, after nearly a year, he was the one and only person to even "notice" DraStic wasn't working properly, at least enough to TELL ME SO:)  Thanks, mate!  Now, it is fixed:)

This has been a problem for quite some time, as MD Mini Inputs are generally off by a value of - or + 1, depending on the variables involved.  This also affects RetroArch usage and default 3/6 button controllers, which are also fixed up for THIS Release, next section:)  Anyways, only a select number of controllers actually have ability to engage DraStic, when MD Mini is involved.  Robbalvey helped immensely in this process, to try to fix things up, so we can run MORE controllers, by default!  Bslenul, also helped, incredibly, with the coding execution, so I don't have to separate DraStic into separate builds for MD/SNES/NES!  PSC is its own thing, also fixed up for this Release!  But, now, you can install updated DraStic, no matter if on MD/SNES/NES.  And, if on MD, controls will automatically work for most controllers, so you can at least play games like New Super Mario, Tetris, TrackMania, and other D Pad Geared Games!  You can tap Start button on controller 2, to access menu, and remap what you need to!  I strongly recommend you do NOT save for ALL games, or even THIS game, unless absolutely certain you are good to go!  This will save you an FTP Headache of needing to delete bad config files!  I also set up the Face Buttons, such as A, B, X, Y, on controller 2, to be able to swap between vertical and horizontal orientation, full to one screen (helps greatly with New Super Mario, Castlevania, etc), and select button AND Reset on the Mini, itself, to exit games!

For those on SNES/NES, controls are geared more towards Xbox/Wii style controllers, and set up for use between 1, 2 schemes.  You can view the readme, while in hakchi, to see exact controls, and nuances to using them.  They can also be remapped!

AutoFrameSkip is set to 2.  This will work, effectively, for MOST games.  Games like Gauntlet DS, the unreleased game, you NEED to have it off completely!  If wanting to run games in HD, you need to set it to 9!  Once you get used to going into the menu, and navigating, you can easily adjust these on the fly, and get back into the fray of action!

You can also select CHEATS, and do moon jumps with Mario Kart, etc!  Fun Fun Stuff:)

Remember, MIC driven games require the /bin/drastic-mic command line, and are not guaranteed to be fully playable!  When you gotta use the MIC to blow candles out in Zelda, for example, you will NEED an appropriate patch, for said game.  And, in the Release Notes of the patch, you can view the controls to do MIC functions!  Princess Peach runs pretty dandy, however!

CHEATS also added to PSC install!  Since DraStic is STILL closed source, there is a very limited amount of things we can do with it!  But, once it becomes open source, hopefully, one day...we can really change things up in a more mod positive way!  Enjoy Nintendo DS, FTW, finally, for MD Mini, too:)

**Mini MD Default Controls Fixed Up!**

As mentioned, controls were goofy and off by a variable of 1, depending on controller, and scenario involved.  Thanks AxelStone, ReyVGM, robbalvey, for helping with testing and fixing up some of these issues!  It is a WIP, so may eventually get a true SDL fix up!  But, for now, most controllers should have a far better shot at controlling more admirably.  Thanks, all of you!  

**Fantastic Gem of a Rogue Lite Dungeon Crawler, Magic Castle!**

This game, made with the Net Yaroze, has surfaced, and is now on Mod Hub, as well as my Google Drive, Games Folder, for PS1!  Thank you ALL who have made this possible!  Nice Rogue Lite Dungeon Crawler!  I also shrunk it down to a nifty 23 MB size, to help those of you still stuck on NAND, more effortlessly handle it!

**NES/PCE Cheats Fix Up!**

Fceumm, PCE Mednafen Fast, both have better Cheats Support, via the installed Cheats and RetroArch Settings, Quick Menu, Cheats, Select Cheats, Apply, Resume:)  These used to have to be hard patched to some games, due to how THESE particular conflicting cheats executed.  All good now:)  Have fun!  Thanks negativeExponent!

**NES Mappers Fleshed Out!**

Personal thanks to NRS-NewRisingSun and negativeExponent for helping make this incredible addition possible!  We can now run the following games, with previously troublesome mappers, with the Updated fceumm Core!  Run with the Non-Xtreme Variant, for now!  Surprisingly, some of the Non-Mini Classics, such as Atari Flashback Mini 7800, Intellivision TV Play Power 25-in-1, etc, have been found out to be comprised of hardware/NES Roms!  This is pretty big news, as these mappers NOW function with THIS Update:)  Aside from the following, be sure to try out any others that previously did not work for you, as they may have a shot at working now.  Many many new mappers added!  Awesome stuff:)

**SNES Slowdown Patch Fixes!**

In Xtras/PERM-CHEATS-PATCHING/SNES, are a nice subset of Patches that you can apply to SNES games, notorious for slowdowns on even the real hardware!  These include Contra III, Gradius III, Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts, Super Mario World, Super R-Type, for starters!  Use floating, lips102, or multipatch, from main directory of PERM-CHEATS-PATCHING, to add these nifty fixes!  Thanks to all who have spent countless hours working on these!  And, thanks BlackSunshine for helping test them!  They work great!  Even the default MD Mini Classic, can better handle THESE above games with the above patches executed! 

**ECWOLF Art Fixed!**  

Art will now display fine for MD/SNES/NES, once downloaded from Mod Hub!  Remember, you need RetroArch, ECWOLF Core AND Game installed!

**Closing Notes and WIP**

You all have been incredibly great over the last four years! Looking forward to seeing where things may lead in 2021! Now it is time to work and, in between, catch up on the hundreds of messages I have gotten over the last few days! Thank all of you wonderful Ladies and Gentlemen for your ongoing support, as always!  

For NEXT Update, I will take into account End User Feedback, and do what I can to further Update these Cores!  And, try to take a few other Cores to more Ludicrous Xtreme Proportions, including PS1!  And, who knows, possibly Saturn, too!  If I can get Saturn running as well as LudicrousN64, then even Sonic R and Burning Rangers should work a hell of a lot better!!!  Feel free to make suggestions on a few Cores that may benefit from some Ludicrous'esque coding changes:)

Now, off to check out a few movies, Let Him Go (Kevin Costner), News of the World (Tom Hanks), Trial of the Chicago 7 (Borat, for those who don't know his real name!  Awesome actor, period!  Enjoy THIS Update.  And, thanks again for being so patient!  Tune into Discord, Reddit, my YouTube Channel for Updates regarding the NEXT Update:)

Sincerely, KMFDManic!
