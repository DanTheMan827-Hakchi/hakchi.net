In order to use the Borders, go into RetroArch Settings, Onscreen Overlay, Select from
SGB 16x9, and whichever pertinent .cfg file applies to said game you choose to run.  You 
will also need to toggle on Enable Overlay for it to properly display.  To revert, simply
rinse and repeat, selecting default.cfg from Onscreen Overlay.  To switch back to original
Aspect Ratio, go into RetroArch Settings, Video Settings, Aspect Ratio, set to Core Provided, 
or whichever one suits your personal preference.
