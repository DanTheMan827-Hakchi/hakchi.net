**Zram (Virtual Swap Compressed in Ram! Only Works with Hakchi2 CE 3.4.1; Installs automatically with later Hakchis!** 

Star Fox 64, as a test example...always crashes after you beat the 1st level!  Mario Kart 64 crashes, on average, every 30 Minutes.  Zram alots more optimal memory usage.  And, as a result, you are 99.7 percent less likely to encounter such crashes in N64 games that have been prone to such instances in the past!

PSP Games also get a nominal boost, and crash less!
