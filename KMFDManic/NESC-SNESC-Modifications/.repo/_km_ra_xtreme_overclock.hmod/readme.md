**Warnings and Xtreme Overclock Usage!!!**
- Recommended to use Easy OC from Modules, KMFD Mod Hub, Games Tab for ease of use reliability for toggling On/Off!
- With Easy OC, you don't even need to install Xtreme Overclock, as they are one in the same...with Easy having toggle support, courtesy of bslenul!:)
- Xtreme Overclock is meant for those who want it permanently on, without toggling, and have a quality assurance factory supported chip!
- If neither Xtreme or Easy OC work well for you, you simply DO NOT have a supported chip.  You can use Easy OC to toggle it On/Off permanently!
- Use Xtreme OC at your own risk! We are NOT responsible for any physical damage, although quite unlikely, that may occur from (mis)use of this HMOD!  You've been warned!
- It will NOT work for all Mini MD-S-NESC Units, due to chip "Mhz Quality Assurance Pass Test" variances in the manufacturing process!
- Do not attempt to use Xtreme OC with anything other than the latest RetroArch Xtreme, which is optimized to better handle it!
- If power source is too low (should be at least 5V/2A+)/draw is too high (USB-HOST, additional USB Devices), crashes/reboots may occur on more cpu intensive games/cores, such as Dreamcast! 
- If you encounter crashes/reboots, and ARE on an appropriate hardware set-up, then your system's chip is likely NOT fully compatible with Xtreme Overclock!
- Xtreme OC can be disabled (Defaults to 1.008 Ghz for MD/1.2 Ghz for S-NESC) within Hakchi2 CE with Connected Mini MD-S-NESC, via Tools, Open Telnet Client, log in with Host Name: 169.254.13.37, Pass: root, and simply type in hakchi overclock boot, then Enter!  
- Xtreme OC can be reenabled (Sets to 1.34 Ghz for MD-S-NESC) with exact same steps as above, but by typing in hakchi overclock max, then Enter!
- Xtreme OC current temperature and Mhz can be verified with same steps as above, and typing of hakchi overclock, then Enter!
- To Manually Xtreme OC individual games to 1.34 Ghz for S-NESC, simply add a space, then --overclock to the end of each Command Line.  All other games will run at default 1.2 Ghz.    
- To Automatically Xtreme OC ALL games for S-NESC to 1.34 Ghz, remove all instances of --overclock from Command Lines.  MD, for now, with Xtreme OC installed, will affect ALL games.
