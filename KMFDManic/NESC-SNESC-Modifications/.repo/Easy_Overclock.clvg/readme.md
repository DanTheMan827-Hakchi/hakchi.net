**This is an Easy way of running Xtreme Overclock, On The Fly!  Simply Synch or Export "Easy Overclock", then run it like
any other Game!  You will be able to Toggle it On/Off anytime you so choose to, as well as see current Mhz/Temp!  Not only
that, you don't even have to install the separate Xtreme Overclock HMOD, as this one will revert to stock Mhz upon every
shutdown!  For now, it works best with the controller that is in Port 1.  But, this may change in future Updates!**
