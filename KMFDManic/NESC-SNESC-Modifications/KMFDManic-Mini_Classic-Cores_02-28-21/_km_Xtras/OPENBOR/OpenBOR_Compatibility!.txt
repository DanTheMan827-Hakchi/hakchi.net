Huge personal and tremendous thanks to all Creators and Developers who have ever worked on any OpenBOR Game, as well
as the OpenBOR Game Engine, itself!

These test results come courtesy of myself (KMFDManic), bslenul, and DRVR 99!  Enjoy!

**NOTE: Not all OpenBOR games will work.  There are memory limitations to how much can be allocated, causing some
games to crash before fully loading.  Other games, due to being coded on earlier OpenBOR games, might also have
conflicts or issues.  We will try to get some of these sorted out, if at all possible to!**

NESC/SNESC = Use OpenBOR Core and /bin/openbor  Simply add .pak as a game, making sure it is not compressed!

PSC = Use included PSP OpenBOR Eboot inside Xtras/PS CLASSIC  Games will not run full speed!  PSC implementation
of OpenBOR should work out in the future, so you can run these amazing games "full speed ahead!"  Being that the
PSC also has 1 GB of ram, memory issues with allocation should not be a problem!  

Now then, here are the test results:)  These may be Updated, in future Releases!
