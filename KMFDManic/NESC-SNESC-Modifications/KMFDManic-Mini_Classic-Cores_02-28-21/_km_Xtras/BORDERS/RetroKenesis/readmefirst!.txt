*Version - 5/31/17

I have provided config files for use in junction with RetroArch as well as overlays that support 1080p as well as 720p now! Be sure to use the folders that best suit your resolution! I have provided 4 different types of overlays for console overlays...Regular, Horizontal Scanlines (labeled with "h" at the end of the file), Vertical Scanlines (labeled with "h" at the end of the file), and Grill Scanlines (labeled with "g" at the end of the file). Everything is Subject to change! Even the overlays that are not WIPs could possibly be changed in the future. There will be MANY updates in the near future. Stay Tuned!
