The script will recursively search through whichever directory
it is in, as well as subdirectories, and auto convert
bin+cue, as well as iso files, to chd files:)  You can just copy
and paste, or drag and drop bin+cue and/or or iso files into the
directory containing chdman + _km_bin_cue_&_iso_to_chd.bat, as well:)

Due to many variables and compatibility between Cores that support CHD, it is recommended you try out V4 AND V5
in any given circumstance, to ensure you have the most optimal conversion.

IE: If you attempt a V5 conversion with PS1 Games, some may have no music if run through CDMage and become .bin+.cue
Whereas, a proper .cuesheet  would potentially have correct sound.  And, due to Arm conflicts, V4 tends to work best
for Sega Saturn/Sega Dreamcast.  So, until you get the hang of things, try a few different conversions!
