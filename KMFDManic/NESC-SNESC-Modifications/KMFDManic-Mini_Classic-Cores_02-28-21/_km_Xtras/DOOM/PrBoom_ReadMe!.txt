Personal thanks to John Romero, ID Software, bslenul, madmonkey, Florian Schulze, Ferk, and the PrBoom Team!

**To make things easier and more convenient, I have added some DOOM games (including SIGIL) to KMFD Mod Hub, 
Games Tab, in Hakchi2 CE!  Any you'd like to run OSTs with, simply copy and paste the properly named and format
OSTs to said CLV Folders!  For PS Classic Users, you can get them from Xtras/DOOM and/or Xtras/Games/DOOM**

Enjoy!  KMFDManic!

Given you have PrBoom Core installed, you can run Doom 1, 2, Plutonia, TNT, and...now SIGIL .wads!
Other .wads work, too.  But, they are not guaranteed to work as well as the above listed ones!
You can, additionally, add Full CD Soundtracks to these!  Simply have the exact named files, per
below...inside same folder as the .wad  

**prboom.wad is no longer needed:)  SIGIL_COMPAT.wad is included, in the event you need it.
I personally have not needed it, though!**

**Recommended course of action, if wanting to run Buckethead OST on SNESC/NESC, is to use .mp3s!
Due to memory constraints and limitations, you may encounter crashing on load when attempting to use
SIGIL_SHREDS.wad (alternative OST method).  SIGIL_SHREDS.wad works absolutely fine on PSC, however!**

**You can "purchase" the Buckethead OST in .mp3 format from his "Pikes" site.  Two tracks will be missing.**

These are: 

(Eye on Spiral Part 1 (5:18) which is to be renamed to inter.mp3
(Triceratoptron (3:31) which is to be renamed to intro.mp3

**wadext_win32.zip, in DOOM folder, can be used to extra SIGIL_SHREDS.wad into .lmp format files,
which simply need to be renamed to .mp3 as per the exact names below:)  Simply extract wadext.exe, 
then drag SIGIL_SHREDS.wad onto it!  The resulting files, as mentioned, need renamed to .mp3 format.**

SIGIL NESC/SNESC without OST:

- You will need FULL, not shareware, version of DOOM!  
- Add SIGIL.wad as a game in hakchi, then copy doom.wad into resulting CLV folder.  /bin/prboom

SIGIL NESC/SNESC with MP3 OST:):

- Again, FULL, not shareware, version of DOOM!
- Add SIGIL.wad as a game in hakchi, then copy doom.wad into resulting CLV folder. /bin/prboom
- Copy prboom.cfg from Xtras/DOOM/SIGIL/MP3.cfg folder into CLV
- Copy exact, case sensitive named mp3s to CLV, as detailed below.

SIGIL PSC without OST:

- Simply create a folder inside your games folder.
- Copy full version of DOOM, named as doom.wad
- Copy included SIGIL.wad into same folder.
- Load SIGIL.wad with PrBoom:)

SIGIL PSC with MP3 OST (Loads Faster than Shreds Method!:)
