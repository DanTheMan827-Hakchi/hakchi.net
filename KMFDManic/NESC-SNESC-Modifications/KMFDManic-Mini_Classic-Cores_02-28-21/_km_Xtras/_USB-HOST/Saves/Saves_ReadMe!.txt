**Back Up Your Saves Using Save State Manager FIRST.  Your Saves are
your own responsibility.**

Courtesy of DanTheMan827, you now have the ability to TRANSFER Saves
between NAND and USB!

Simply copy the pertinent TRANSFER File into hakchi/transfer folder!

NAND = Saves are PUSHED to NAND

USB = Saves are PUSHED to USB

Be sure to have /hakchi/saves folder!
