ATTENTION:)  In order to use the NEW RetroArchs in my Core Set,
you will need to take the included remote-exec file and OVERWRITE
the current one in your hakchi2 directory.

1.  CTRL+F

2.  Search for remote exec

3.  Open Containing Directory

4.  Let included one overwrite it

**Then, for anyone with issues running NES/SNES should be back in 
action!  And, of course, Special Characters will work for USB-HOST!

Directory the remote-exec is in...

hakchi2/mods/mod_hakchi/hakchi/rootfs/bin

Personal thanks to Madmonkey for helping fix this:)

Sincerely, KMFDManic

NOTE: All Hakchi1/Hakchi2 Variants in my 1-28-18 Core Set
have this hotfix already applied.
