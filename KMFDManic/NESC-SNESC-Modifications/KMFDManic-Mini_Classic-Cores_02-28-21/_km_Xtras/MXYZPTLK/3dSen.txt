3dSen is an amazing PC Emulator by Studio Geod that currently supports roughly 70 games, in mindblowing 3D!

I will personally keep tabs on this, as well as analyze how the various game assets work, and
update this ReadMe as I post future Updates!  As of right now, the first results are in:

- Batman Profile - "Zombie Hunter" has a decent pseudo 3D Effect, complete with shadows!

- Castlevania Profile - "Castlevania Extreme" shares same game assets as Castlevania, as it is a hack!
So, in that respect, it is nearly as full blown 3D as one could expect, without being officially
supported as a Profile!

I will update more as I test further.  This is so on par with the times I was testing Phantasy
Star Online Codebreaker Additions I was working on, as well as the amazing Randomized Monster
Generations by putting real CDs into the PS1, when playing Monster Rancher!  Fun Stuff!  

Stay Tuned for more magic, courtesy of Studio Geod, as well as Exploits myself and others discover!
