Hello everyone!  With PPSSPP Xtreme, you can utilize Cheats!  In order to do this, follow these steps...

1.  Have latest AutoBleem/BleemSync Injector if on PSC; latest RetroArch Xtreme if on NESC/SNESC

2.  Play any PSP game, then shut down your system.

3.  Your saves directory, within PSP/Cheats, should now contain a fresh and new .ini file.

Example Save Directories:

PSC: AutoBleem - retroarch/saves/PSP/Cheats; BleemSync - bleemsync/opt/retroarch/saves/PSP/Cheats
NESC/SNESC - hakchi/retroarch/saves/PSP/Cheats

Note: PSP/Game can be used for DLC content.

4.  You can amend this .ini file with Notepad or similarly minded program, to manually add Cheats.

5.  The cheat.zip contains a database that you can peruse for exact Cheats that can be added.

6.  CWCheat Database Editor is convenient to be able to quickly access .ini ID numbers, etc.

7.  C0 = OFF; C1 = ON, as far as toggling Cheats.

Enjoy!

Sincerely, KMFDManic!
