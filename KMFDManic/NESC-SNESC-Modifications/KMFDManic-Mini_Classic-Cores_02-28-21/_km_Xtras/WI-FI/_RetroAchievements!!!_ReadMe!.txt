1.  Go to RetroAchievements.org, and make an account.  Make sure to validate your account
via email!  If it fails, use an alternate email, and/or make a forum post to get validated!
Then, fill in your USER+PASS in RetroArch Settings/Quick Menu/Achievements to have access
to them from that point on!

2.  You can reset Achievements on RetroAchievements.org, as well!  This is a very nice ability
that is not at all possible on Playstation/XBOX!!!

3.  RetroAchievements are NOT available for ALL Games & Cores.  If ONLINE, load a game from
either main UI OR Dummy Folder, and go into RetroArch Options/Quick Menu/Achievements.  You
will then see whether or not you can get Achievements for this given game!

3.  If you have any difficulty running Sfrom SNES Games, you can bypass sfrom conversion 
simply by 7zipping ANY .zipped SNES Game, then adding it via Hakchi2 CE!  The second layer
of compression is unable to be read by Hakchi2 CE.  Simply change command line to /bin/snes
after doing this, if one single SNES Core is installed.  Or, change to /bin/snes02, 
/bin/snes05, /bin/snes10, OR /bin/snes9x or /bin/snes16, depending on which Core is
installed!  Madmonkey did a great coding addition to help sfrom converted games retain
their original mdf hash checksums!  So, you should not need to use the bypass method!
But, this is how to do it, just in case!

Have fun!
