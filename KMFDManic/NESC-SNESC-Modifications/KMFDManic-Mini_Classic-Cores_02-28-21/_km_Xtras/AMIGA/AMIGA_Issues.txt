Amiga has a very huge cult following!  As a result, this Core is getting its own, very special Issues File.

Basically, any known issues us Amiga fans have, I will post in this Txt file.  And if anyone figures out how
to resolve them, and communicates with me, hilly, qclart, and company, the solution will be updated into the 
Amiga Set-Up!

First issue was Cropped Video, which qclart addressed in a Template Update, and is also now fixed here:)  One 
can still adjust aspect ratio via RetroArch, if need be!

Other current issues running CD32 Games with CD Audio.

Thank you, all fellow Amiga Fans!  Let us all make this amazing Core the best it can possibly be!

Sincerely, KMFDManic!!!
