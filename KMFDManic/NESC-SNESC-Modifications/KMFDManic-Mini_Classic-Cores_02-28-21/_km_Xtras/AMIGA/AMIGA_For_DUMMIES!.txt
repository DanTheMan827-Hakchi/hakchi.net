Tutorial below these quick notes:)

Amiga (500)  = (OCS) = Original Chip set
Amiga (600)  = (ECS) = Enhanced Chip Set
Amiga (1200) = (AGA) = Advanced Graphics Architecture (Slow!)

P-UAE Standard = Best for Mouse Driven/.m3u playlist games
P-UAE Xtreme   = 2 Player Mode Activate/Bigger Keyboard/GUI Removed/More Optimal Control Scheme!

Xtreme Controls:

L2 = show/hide status
R2 = UNUSED
L = mouse speed down (min 1)
R = mouse speed up (max 6)
SEL = toggle mouse/joy mode
STR = show/hide virtual keyboard (vkbd)
A = joystick fire 1/mouse 1/vkbd key pressed
B = joystick fire 2/mouse 2
X = UNUSED
Y = UNUSED

Hello everyone!  It is now time to make Amiga so much easier for you all:)  I give personal thanks to all who have worked on
the original P-UAE, the WHDLoad Team, Commodore, the company behind AMIGA.  The collaborative efforts of madmonkey, qclart, and
myself (KMFDManic) has ended up with some truly amazing Amiga awesomeness on the Mini Classics.  Enjoy!

First of all, forget all you have seen, done, heard, since the advent of AMIGA emulation on the Mini Classics!  Throw that all
out the window.  We will be doing this in a very new and incredibly special way, right here and now:)

You will need the following in order to run AMIGA, first and foremost...

- For the Mini NES/SNES Classics, install latest RetroArch Xtreme from primary Release, and/or from KMFD Mod Hub, RetroArch, along
with the P-UAE Standard and/or Xtreme Core Variants.

- For the Playstation Classic, install from PS CLASSIC folder, the latest injector for AutoBleem or BleemSync

Next up, you will need to account for the BIOS, which are absolutely mandatory.  There is no way around this!  You can find them
online, or purchase them on your mobile phone for approximately 3 USD, or on PC from AmigaForever.com website for roughly 30 USD.

**BIOS** wise, you will need the following:

Note: I have personally found that a majority of games can run with "Just" WHDLoad.hdf and kick40063.a600  Most Amiga 1200 games
run slow.  So, I would consider kick40068.a1200 somewhat optional, along with the lesser used kick34005.a500  So, take that with
a grain of salt, as far as minimal or maximum installations!  

Note 2: In order to run Amiga 500 or Amiga 1200 Games, you will need to have (OCS) or (500) as part of the file name for Amiga 500.
And, (AGA) or (1200) as part of the file name for Amiga 1200.  You can, additionally, save game override to 500 or 1200 for these.

IE: Agony.hdf will give you an error message that you don't have enough cpu.  Agony(AGA).hdf will detect as a 1200 game!
Unfortunately, the way the SNES/NES Classic works with special characters, parenthesis are auto removed.  So, you would need
to either direct load them, or amend the file name AND Command Line within hakchi, after the fact (adding them!) to work.

Again, 1200 AKA AGA games run SLOW!  And, 500 games are few and far between.  So, you will not run into many cases where you
will need to, nor even want to run these.  But, if you do, 1200 (AGA) games do run better on Playstation Classic.  And, you
can alternately use UAE4ARM with .uae files on SNES/NES Classic to get "full speed" AGA games.  This won't work on PS Classic,
as of yet!

Now then,

Name	        Description	                System	        MD5

WHDLoad.hdf     Loads .hdf games                Amiga ALL                                  
kick34005.A500	Kickstart v1.3 Rev. 34.005	Amiga 500	82a21c1890cae844b3df741f2762d48d  Kickstart v1.3 rev 34.5 A500-A1000-A2000-CDTV
kick40063.A600	Kickstart v3.1 Rev. 40.063	Amiga 600	e40a5dfb3d017ba8779faba30cbd1c8e  Kickstart v3.1 Rev 40.063 a600
kick40068.A1200	Kickstart v3.1 Rev. 40.068	Amiga 1200	646773759326fbac3b2311fd8c8793ee  Kickstart v3.1 rev 40.68 A1200

WHDLoad.hdf will automatically install with the injector/s for Playstation Classic.  For the NES/SNES Classics, you can install
the RetroArch BIOS P-UAE WHDLoad.hmod from primary Release, and/or from KMFD Mod Hub, under Add-Ons!

The other 3 files need to be exactly named as specified in the leftmost column.  To install these:  

- On the NES/SNES Classic, use the Master BIOS Module from primary Release and/or KMFD Mod Hub, under Xtras.  Copy them to the root,
then install the entire HMOD like any other HMOD, via Modules Tab within Hakchi2 CE!

- On the Playstation Classic, navigate to retroarch/system, and directly copy the BIOS there.

**Running Games**

You will be able to directly load a majority of .adf games simply by Load Core, Load Content, with PS Classic.  And, on SNES/NES
Classics, add .adf files, with command line /bin/puae  And, as long as BIOS are properly installed and accounted for, and you are
using the appropriate RetroArch installation for whichever mini system, as I suggested above, you will be good to go!

**Slightly More Advanced Users**

You can run multi disk games, without needing to have in .hdf (Hard Drive Image Files), via .m3u playlists!  I include a template
one for Apydia in Xtras/AMIGA, as well as Xtras/MULTI-DISK.  You can amend this to match whichever games you need to run.  

IE: 

Apidya (1992)(Kaiko - Play Byte)[cr QTX](Disk 1 of 2).adf
Apidya (1992)(Kaiko - Play Byte)[cr QTX](Disk 2 of 2).adf

When prompted to switch to Disk 2 or more, go to RetroArch Settings, Disk Control, then change to the specified disk, in question...
then, append to it!  This will only work with Standard P-UAE Core, for now...Not P-UAE Xtreme.  

**More Advanced Users**

HDF Files are Hard Drive Images for Amiga Games.  You can find these online...But, they will mostly not work, in their current state.
They would need fixed.  I have posted a video tutorial on my YouTube Channel, called "Playstation Classic - Amiga For Dummies - Tutorial", 
to help you all along!  You will use the ADFOpus program that I include in my Release, under Xtras/AMIGA!  

Note: When fixing and repacking and creating .hdf files, they should be 2 MB and up in size, or you may run into error messages with
ADFopus.  Additionally, game.slave should be utilized as the naming convention for whichever current game_name_here.slave exists, or 
.hdf files will NOT boot!  


**Way More Advanced Users**

You can run .uae files, which I include templates for...that qclart and myself had worked on previously..in Xtras/AMIGA/Amiga_Template.7z
.uae files are essentially configuration files that set up the perimeters for the games that need to be run.  These are tricky to use.
And, they are most certainly not as User Friendly as the Direct Load method I detail above!  You will need to refer to the original 
AMIGA_ReadMe! for more information on these.  You will be able to run a great majority of games with the Direct Load method, which
again, will more likely be the go to method for Non Way More Advanced Users!  You "may" experience performance hits, depending on
which architecture's games you are running, be it Original, Enhanced, or Advanced Chip Sets.  Advanced will ALWAYS run slow, period!

Good luck!

Sincerely, KMFDManic...

PS, as always, let me know if any of you need help or assistance with any of this.  The cat sometimes bumps the keyboard, as well:)
