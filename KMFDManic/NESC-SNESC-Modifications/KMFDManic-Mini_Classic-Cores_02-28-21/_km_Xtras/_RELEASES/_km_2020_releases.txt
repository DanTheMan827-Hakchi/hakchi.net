**12-25-2020**

Hope all you have been enjoying your day!  The Release is going quite nicely.  But, it may not make the target goal I had hoped for, 1-1-21.  I have, unfortunately, been working additional hours filling in for other coworkers who have been out due to Covid.  This certainly puts a tad bit more time contraints on finishing up in time!  But, rest assured, I will get it out as soon as possible!  Keep checking on my YouTube Channel, and you will "soon" see a nice 5K Celebration video Pre-Release, which will cover a nice sampling of Nintendo 64 Games that will work in the Update!  

**10-06-2020**

**Today is your lucky day.  I meant to post this on October 6th.  But, I finished a little earlier, and didn't want to have you all waiting 2 more days!  So, enjoy the Update, 2 days early, still dated for October 6th!!!  Looking forward to the feedback!**

You can grab the Release from either the way way way down Assets Link, Google Drive, and/or Hakchi (MD/SNES/NES)  Source Files I will get Updated over Next Day or so.  Was short on time, and definitely wanted you all to be surprised with this earlier Release!

**First Off, let's get some HORROR 'Stravaganza 2020 Edition in:)**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4FiuMzQdQw

**Next Up**

Staind Song, "It's Been Awhile", sums it up.  But, here we are, again, almost 4 months later...with another truly kickass Update!  There were quite a few variables in play, this time around, which made this particular Update take longer than the norm.  These included real life reality and work debacles, meticulous testing phase scenarios to ensure what I wanted to pull off was feasible, with as little chance of buggery and such.  You will see some of the things I have contended with, as you read the Release Notes!  So, sit right back, and you will read a tale, a tale of a fateful modding trip...You get the idea:)  Have fun with this Update, after you get through the Notes, whilst downloading it:)

I have been switching it up between Work, Modding, and trying to get in some fun "binge watching" of TV Shows, here and there.  What shows have you ever "binge watched"?  And, yeah, there is that joke about Netflix emailing people for watching too many episodes of Orange is the New Black and/or The Office, in a row:)  In recent times, I did:

**Ozark** (truly looking forward to the next season..great crime drama about money laundering), 

**Lucky Pete** (Bryan Cranston is a fun villain in season 1! Show is about someone who takes someone elses identity to escape his sordid past...not realizing the guy's life he took is potentially worse than his own!)

**Anger Management** Charlie Sheen in classic, crazy form:)

**Greatest American Hero** (Grew up on this show! Superhero loses instruction manual and learns as he goes, while crash landing in humorous ways, each and every time:)

I will probably do Ray Donovan next, as it is clearly a good show that I simply did not get into, as of yet!  I'd absolutely love to know anything and everything any of you have binge watched!  

**Now then, you know the drill...Bullet Points, then clarity.  Time to lift off and get into this Update!**

**Personal Appreciation for those who helped make 5000 Subscriber YouTube Milestone!**

I am giving a tremendous personal thanks to all of you who have helped get me to the 5000 Subscriber YouTube Milestone.  The combination of your pure, unadulterated awesomeness, Liking, Subscribing, Commenting, has gotten me to that fun junction in YouTube Time:)  Thanks so much!  And, I will be doing a 5K Celebration Video, wherein I take on a multitude of games with many many enemies, in fact...5K, give or take:)

**TRUE Metal Gear 1 and 2 for MSX Controls Implemented! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Those who followed the Releases for awhile, will have known Turrican for C64 was the game that truly made me want to have keyboard to controller mapping, of which fr500 and r-type were both graciously amazing in helping out with!  In any case, I set up controls (most optimal for PS2 style controllers!) so that you can easily play the TRUE Metal Gear 1 and 2 via MSX!  You simply add the games, per normal, then run them, and go into RetroArch Settings, Quick Menu, Controls, Load the Mapper, BlueMSX, Kojima Metal Gear 1 & 2!  I streamlined things, as best I could, such as putting the Item/Weapon Menus onto L1/R1, Codec on Select, Action/Start/Continue Buttons on A/B/X/Y.  I can do same for any other MSX/DOS, etc, computer relative games that any of you have difficulty setting up or running, for that matter!  Just let me know:) 
Enjoy!  Legal BIOS will install automatically with Xtreme Injector for PSC.  For the MD/SNES/NES Classics, go to Modules, KMFD Mod Hub, BIOS Tab, and install the appropriate BlueMSX Bios Module!  Thanks Devarchivist for pushing me to get this done this time around:)

**MAME 2003 Xtreme Virtua Fighter Arcade Support Added! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

It is no secret that 3d Arcade Fighting Games run like crap on pretty much all of the Minis, aside from Dreamcast/Naomi/Atomiswave interpretations!  Virtua Fighter is one I really wanted added.  And, it runs best with MAME 2003 Xtreme, especially on PSC!  So, it is officially, the one and only 3D Fighting Game that runs well on the MAME Cores!  Hopefully, we can get more added, in the future!  Personal thanks to Arcadez2003 for helping with the nuances of clocking it, especially so, to handle the lower spec Mini Classics!  You will see in my video, below the notes, the few builds I had to go through, just to get things right!

**MAME 2003 Xtreme Hunting Games Support Added! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

American Sammy's fun Arcade Gun Games, such as:

- deerhunta 
- deerhuntb 
- turkhunt
- wschamp
- wschampa
- trophyh

Personal thanks to Arcadez2003 and Grant2258 for helping with this addition.  I will likely finetune the precision of the controller, Next Update!  But, this is an excellent start!  You can see similar revisions if you try running Duck Hunt VS, which I made far easier to manage on a controller, in recent Updates!  I will do same for these fun Hunting Games, where no real animals are injured or maimed or killed!

**MAME 2003 Xtreme Golfing Games Support Added! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Incredible Technologies' fun Golfing Games, including:

- gt3d
- gt97
- gt98
- gt99
- gt2k
- gtclassc

Thanks for the assist Arcadez2003 and Grant2258, you both rock!

**MAME 2003 Plus Midway Fixes (WWF Wrestlemania Arcade! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Personal thanks to Mahoneyt944 for helping make this incredible addition possible!  WWF Wrestlemania Arcade now has proper, and nice, and loud sound!

**MAME 2003 Plus Midway Fixes! (Terminator 2, Revolution X) (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Two of the most notoriously annoying Arcade Gun Games to get up and running, due to pesky controls and/or sound issues!  No more!  Thank you Mahoneyt944 for helping make this possible to now have Auto Calibrated Controls for both Terminator 2 and Revolution X, as well as Loud, Nice sound for Revolution X!  MAME 2003 Xtreme Amped, in the Next Update, will reflect these amazing changes, too!  That is currently WIP, as I didn't want to delay this Update any longer!

**MAME 2003 Plus Food Fight Proper Controls! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Thanks to Mahoneyt944, you now have the ability to go into MAME Settings, and set appropriate "stop and turn on a dime" controls, to really have more finesse and finetuned precision in this highly addictive game.  Be sure to check out the video below Release Notes for more details!

**PSP Xtreme Amped! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

First we had PPSSPP Legacy, for stubborn games, then PPSSPP Xtreme, for a combination of stability and compatibility.  Now, we have PPSSPP Xtreme Amped, which takes things to the next level!  This cranks performance and speed to whole new levels and the NEXT Addition is one of the fruits of this labor!  On MD/SNES/NES Classic, you can now finally and reasonably play Ultimate Ghosts 'n Goblins, as well as enjoy boosted Performance/Speed on a ton of games!  One main caveat is that on the MD Mini, running games with PPSSPP Xtreme Amped from the Main UI can lead to a glitch where you are running the game and Main UI simultaneously!  Check my YouTube Channel for a Video showcasing the workaround for this!  PPSSPP Xtreme Amped for MD/SNES/NES will be in Mod Hub, KMFD Xtreme Tab, where other specialized, non-typical End User Stuff will be stored, moving forward!

 The other thing to contend with is that games that have FMVs in them, such as God of War, may crash!  You can workaround this, much like with Metroid Prime Hunters, where you utilize save points to bypass crash or non-passable points.  In this case, run God of War Ghost of Sparta with PPSSPP Xtreme, get to the first save point, THEN reload same exact game with PPSSPP Xtreme Amped, and you will have a great while before having to worry about any FMV Crash Points!  I played for a good couple hours swapping between the Xtreme and Amped, and thoroughly enjoyed some good ol God of War, pre Last of US rehash:)  Not that that is a bad thing!  I just enjoy the classic GOW, too:)

**PSP Sonic Rivals 1 and 2 Finally Playable! (Mini PSC)**

This is ONLY possible on PSC due to the Xtreme Timing Differentials to account for with these 2 very tricky games!  They are now both quite playable!  If you use my Xtreme Injector setup for PSC, you will be immediately in action for both of them, upon load!  Results elsewhere may lead to crashes, freezes, burns, and whatnot!  Remember, things are most finetuned to avoid crashes, with the Xtreme Injector setup.  So, keep that in mind, and enjoy both of these fantastic PSP Games!

**PSP Standalone! (Mini PSC)**

We have had a great amount of Drama in the Scene.  But, when it comes down to it, it is all about you, the End User, that matters most!  Our groups have worked on our various projects, and conflicted, creatively, on occasion!  But, I need not humble myself by saying thanks for your efforts with PPSSPP Standalone, Swing and Wraith.  It is a true thanks!  And, also thanks Genderbent for the critical Retroboot Installation Protocols which make APPs much more seamless in execution!  In any case, I added my own personalized Xtreme Tweaks to help out a bit with some of the more Stubborn Games, such as Rock Band Unplugged!  Be sure to watch the Rock Band Unplugged DLC Video Below Notes, as an example!  Feel free to ask me for help, if you have any trouble getting DLC going on ANY game!  I enjoy testing these fun things out, for sure!

Install, from my Release, in PSC Folder, AB, AutoBleem, then Xtreme Injector, then RB Apps, PPSSPP Standalone, then simply navigate to where your games are, and have fun running them!  I got Sonic Rivals 1 and 2 running a tad better.  Rock Band Unplugged considerably better.  But, I definitely recommend most games be run via PPSSPP Xtreme or Amped, and the stubborn ones like Rock Band Unplugged via Standalone!  Be sure to inform me of personal results of testing between these 3 incarnations of PPSSPP, so I can test, and confirm, and update things accordingly!

**PicoDrive 32X Support Fixed! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Pesky Butterfly Mod Effect broke 32X Support in the last Update...All good now!

**Genesis Plus GX MSU-MD CD Soundtrack Support!  (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

This is pretty tricky to set-up.  I may have to do a Tutorial Video on overall setup and patching!  But, the video below notes shows this awesome sauce in action, especially the amazing Michael Jackson's Moonwalker with Real Songs!  I will do my best to make running these as easily as possible.  These will ONLY work with Genesis Plus GX Plus, NOT Xtreme.  Xtreme is set up in such a way that it favors Speed and Performance for games, such as Sonic Spinball, and is not meant for stuff like MD-CD!  Some Sega-CD Games also benefit with Xtreme.  
 
**Commodore 64 Vic-20 Support Added! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

This was a tricky one.  Now, both homebrew AND retail games mostly run, as well as MegaCarts (which can contain nearly the entirely library of any game you'd ever want to play Vic-20 wise!  If I can legally post the MegaCarts, I will to Mod Hub!  I will display them in a video, then post on Google Drive, temporarily, if need be...to avoid any unnecessary delays in bringing you more awesomeness to play on your Minis!

Thank you Sonninos and RSN8887!  And, thanks robbalvey for helping test these additions for a few hours!

**Commodore Amiga Revamped! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Amiga will continue to be Revamped, each and every Update.  Performance and Speed is better, flickering fixed up, other fun tweaks and fixes, making it a better all around Core!  Thank you Sonninos and RSN8887!

**Driver PSX No Longer Crashes on Restart! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)

What is more irritating than the unpassable Tutorial Mission in Driver!?  Well, that would be going to Restart, after failing, then having the entire game crash!  No more, all good to go now, with ALL of the Updated PCSX Builds!  You can also play the Japan Version, to entirely skip the Tutorial Mission, as a great bit of wisdom someone passed along to me in YouTube Comments!  Just, after that, game won't be in English! 
 But, still very damned cool!  Thanks!  

**PSX Bugs Fixed! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Disk Swapping wasn't 100 percent reliable and crashed for some more often than not.  Everything is fixed now, and I had multiple people test.  Disk Swapping works flawlessly and quite effortlessly now!  Also, if attempting to run games without BIOS, crashing was more prone to occur.  Now, the games that DO work without BIOS, will run fine, without any surprise crashing on startup!    Again, Butterfly Mod Effect, per usual.  Gotta deal with a break, here and there, with the awesome new additions.  But, once the occasional breaks, such as Disk Swapping crashes, or 32X no longer functioning properly, we quickly get off our asses and fix them, if we reasonably can:) Thanks saitax and stefantx and bslenul for testing and confirming the bugs no longer exist:)

**PCSX ReArmed .ldci Support! (Mini MD-S-NESC)**

Thanks bslenul!  This is genius:)  For PCSX, which is really cool for multi-discs games, now it will remember the last disc inserted
so for example you're playing FFVII (from a m3u/pbp) and you're now on disc 2, next time you'll start the game it will boot on disc 2 directly, no need to swap and restart.  This may make it hard code wise for PSC, too, upon more appropriate testing.  But, works fine for MD/SNES/NES, for now!

**PCSX ReArmed HD Xtreme Suite! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Here, we have a masochist's haven suite of specialized PCSX Core Builds, for you to peruse and try out and enjoy!  For MD/SNES/NES Classics, go to Mod Hub, KMFD Xtreme Tab, like with PPSSPP Xtreme Amped...stuff that may not be for every End User, will be there for the elitists who wanna try out the extra oomph up for offer!  You will have NEON, PEOPS, UNAI Xtreme, HD Xtreme, HD Xtreme Amped, HD Xtreme FS, HD Xtreme Amped FS.  Amped Builds will ONLY work with Suspend or RetroArch Saves, NOT in game.  That is a sacrifice that needed made to ensure better performance and speed!  Graphical glitches may also occur.  Think of the cache being overloaded.  If you exit the game and reenter, or restart RetroArch, the game should run fine!  I have to personally say, some of the "not too often" graphical glitches I got, were pretty funny.  One had stormtroopers in Jedi Power Battles being covered up like a certain character that we need not name, that can't be shown, in South Park!  Speaking of South Park, the Covid 19 episode was in top form, highly enjoyable:)

In any event, first try PS1 Games with the standard suite of Cores, then Xtreme, if need be.  And, as far as HD Builds, FS has minor frame skipping involved, to help on games like R-Type Delta, which will run way way way better on MD/SNES/NES, with FS Builds!  And, I tell you, R-Type Delta looks fine in HD!  Feel free to offer feedback, as I have had absolute fun trying out hundreds of games on the various builds, and finding the appropriate and most masterful build for each.  Again, for PSC, simply running HD Xtreme or HD Xtreme Amped will be all that is needed for MOST PS1 Games.  FS is more practical, execution wise, for MD/SNES/NES.  Have fun, I definitely did, getting these all set up for you to all enjoy!  One can never have enough PS1:)  PS: Blood Omen, like in my Video, runs absolutely amazing with HD Xtreme Amped!  I just use RetroArch Saves for it, as I WANT that additional performance and speed, and accountability for HD Upscaled Visuals, to boot!

**Boktai Light Sensor Support for mGBA! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Who the friggin hey wants to take their GBA outside in the sun!  Well, it was still a cool, not very well known gimmick, for this subset of Boktai, Action Adventure Games!  Make sure your Core Option is set to 1 for Light, then calibrate, confirm, in game, and you should be able to simply hold L1 or R1 to adjust light up and down!  You can also utilize the "hard perm patches" in my Release, in Xtras/PERM-CHEATS-PATCHING, to make sure it is enforced, always!  Boktai 3, you will probably want to English Language patch, as well.  I didn't include that patch, for now, as the best patch of it, includes something I cannot post:)  I will try to throw into the Next Update, the most appropriate patch, along with any others I come across, that are impactful:)

**RetroArch Xtreme Amped! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

For MD/SNES/NES, Mod Hub, KMFD RetroArch Tab for Ozone, the most User Friendly Build!  KMFD Xtreme for my specialized for better performance/speed builds of Amped/RGUI (RGUI Loads games approximately 2-3 seconds faster than any other build.  But, it is not the most pretty interface.  It just doesn't need to load as much into memory, before running the games!  For PSC, Xtreme Injector will get you up and running!  For MD/SNES/NES, I have 181 and 190 Xtreme Amped.  PSC, just 181 Xtreme Amped.  I personally found 182-190 still have a few bugs to sort, that make me favor 181 for now on that platform.  You are welcome to try 190 with Genderbent's awesome RetroBoot, however.  But, til I am satisfied the bugs are sorted out, 181 is where I will stay, firm, for now...on PSC!

Additionally, those of you who play N64 the most, may best prefer 181, since you can directly go into RetroArch, Video Settings, SRGB Toggle On/Off on games like Killer Instinct/Paper Mario, to instantly kill slowdown, and reinstate full speed mode activate!  Higher than 181, you have to go through 2 additional submenus, which can be a little more less endearing.  Again, use whichever one you most prefer.  I will get 190 or higher up, once I am comfortable enough with some of the bugs being gone!  These same bugs don't necessarily affect other platforms, as MD/SNES/NES are absolutely fine!  But, for the record, there were some bugs in 184, such as 50+ MB Memory Usage, which in some instances, affected certain games.  That is completely resolved for the 181 and 190 I posted!  It was due to a "RetroAchievements" bug.

**RetroArch Xtreme Amped Sound Check Mode Activate! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

This is not as much about the music, as it is about memory usage!  Whenever you enter RetroArch Menu, in ANY of my Amped Builds, cool, very kickass 1980s style music will play.  If playing a more intensive game, such as Dreamcast, opening RetroArch Menu may cause this music to stutter or slow down.  Anytime you stutter or slowdown, this signifies memory usage, sort of like CTRL+ALT+DEL on a Windows PC!  Depending on where you are in a specific game, it will be best to resume that game to avoid crashing from it, due to too much memory usage, such as with Fist of the North Star...one of the most cpu intensive games, period!  Or, just stop touching your controller for a second or few, til it cleans up!  As long as the music stays smooth, you are generally in no immediately or imminent danger of crashing!  I have found this one of the most practical solutions for surveying exactly how the memory is currently behaving!  Even the built in Memory Usage Detector is quite erratic and unreliable, in contrast, due to how some Cores gather the data.

**Xtreme Virtual Ram Updated! (Mini MD-S-NESC)**

With this installed, you will now have incredible performance and better compatibility!  Doom Sigil will load without crashing, Custom Arcade OSTs, such as NBA Jam and Street Fighter II will properly work.  Naomi/Atomiswave will go from potential 2FPS slowdown, slideshows, to near seamless!  I ran, even Fist of the North Star, quite nicely...on the lower spec MD Mini!  You will have the double whammy of Zfast as well as Swap, along with Turbo Refinement, to help ease along the previous choke points in games for PSP, such as Burnout Legends, which run quite nicely with PPSSPP Xtreme Amped, now!

**Other Additions! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

I made the Load Content more concise, so you don't have 100 characters listed at a time, when seeing what content or Core is loaded.  This harkens back to my Prefix System which I showcased on NESC in 2017.  IE: NES: Blaster Master, rather than Nintendo - Nintendo Entertainment System - Blaster Master, or Nintendo - Nintendo Entertainment System - Nestopia, now is Nintendo - NES - Nestopia!  I really love this, as I don't want to sit there for 2-3 seconds on every Core, waiting for it to scroll by to see what the hell I am working with!  This doesn't affect Ozone as much.  But, with my preferred Amped XMB Builds, it is a little more confined for scrolling sections!  

**MD Mini 6 Button Controller Mostly Fixed Up! (Mini MD)**

Thanks ReyVGM and bslenul for helping with this very frustrating addition.  Many have encountered buttons being wonky or off by one!  We did some extensive testing.  And, with RetroArch Install from THIS Update, your MD 6 Button Controllers, should perform properly.  Note: there are purportedly 4 different 6 Button Controller Types that came with the MD/Genesis Minis.  We did the ones we had access to.  If any of you have ones that still do not work, contact us, and we can help you with the appropriate process of generating a control scheme, which we can put into the install, so you and others can utilize it!  Also, if running MD Games with Genesis Plus or Xtreme GX, you may sometimes need to go into RetroArch Settings, Quick Menu, Controls, and choose between 3/6 button there, depending on game.  Variables.  But, you get the idea!
'
**Next Update WIP (DraStic MD Mini Controls/MAME 2003 Xtreme Amped, etc)!**

DraStic, currently, is quite limited in "what controllers" will auto work with it, for MD Mini!  So, this is a top priority to get fixed up, right after this Update!  They work absolutely fine for SNES/NES.  But, a little additional work is needed to rectify things so they are more appropriately geared for the MD Mini.  For now, you can access the DraStic Menu via holding reset on your MD Mini, for roughly 2 seconds.  And, from there, if you have a working and supported controller, you should have no trouble navigating, and mapping, yourself.  You can also use a keyboard, to make things fast and easy.  And, TWO controllers can actually be used, one in each of the front controller ports, as well!  Again, this is one of the top priorities to fix up, as soon as we reasonably can!  Thanks for all the feedback and input!

I will have 2 MAME 2003 Xtreme Builds, Next Update.  One will favor performance/speed, the other compatibility/stability.  If I can get the better performance/speed on the latter build, I will relegate it to just one build.  But, sometimes, it works best not trying to fix what isn't truly broken!  SO far, in my personal testing, things are looking pretty tip top, as far as a nice Xtreme Amped Build.  I just need to do more recoding, which I don't want to delay this Update, to do.  But, I will certainly showcase this stuff.  Stuff Like Virtua Fighter, etc, may run even better, too, once I am done!

I will get more Games onto the Mod Hub, including some very nice handheld games!  I have wanted to do this for awhile.  This will be the third priority for this followup Update, which won't be 3 months later, like this one was!

Refined Cheat Support for several Cores!  I will showcase this in a few videos.  Some of the most grueling and frustratingly difficult games, will be more approachable with easy access invincibility and/or infinite lives, etc, on the fly:)  You will see:)

**The Videos!** 

Be sure to go to my YouTube Channel, look at most recent, and go backwards, to cover pretty much everything shown in this Update!  But, here are a few stand-out ones to check out, for now:)

**Playstation Classic - Sonic Rivals 1 & 2 Actually Playable!!! Xtreme Amped FTW!!**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az60s0ZYiQc&t=288s

**Playstation Classic - PSX HD Xtreme Amped! Blood Omen Legacy of Kain! + SNES Steven Seagal?**

**Hell, just go to most Recent on my Channel, as mentioned above, and you will see the dozens of other videos posted within the last few months!**

**Enjoy the Friggin' Update!  I will do a 5000 Subscriber Celebration Video when I get the chance!**

KMFDManic:)

**06-23-2020**

**Guess who's back, back again:)?**

Here we are for another Update, touching up a few things, adding others!  I watched Looks That Kill, a new movie, that the trailer would kind of lead you to believe is a comedy!  But, it is actually a well acted Drama movie with a dark comedy twist!  I think it will become a Cult Classic.  And, I overall enjoyed it:)  Now, I need to finish up Future Man!  

And, I randomly started listening to some newer music.  I am quite eclectic in my music tastes, from Chicago, to Electric Light Orchestra, to KMFDM, to Pantera, to some stuff you might not expect me to listen to!  Christine and the Queens I found to be quite interesting.  The lead singer has an amazing voice.  Reminds me quite a bit of the sheer raw power that Beth Ditto of Gossip also has.  And like Beth, Chris simply does not give a rat's ass what others think, and it shows in the pure energy conveyed live and even in the Studio Music!

In any case, let's get to this Update!

- Da Videos!
- VVVVVV Fix Up! (Mini MD-S-NESC)
- Random Game Mode Activate! (Mini MD-S-NESC)
- Genesis Mini Classic (6 Button Fix! (Mini MD)
- Genesis Mini Classic (More Optimal RetroArch Exiting! (Mini MD)
- PS4 Controller Fix! (Mini MD-S-NESC)
- Nestopia Fixed! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)
- Refresher Course on Mod Hub Games! (Mini MD-S-NESC)
- 3D NES Games Possible on the Mini Classics?! 
- WIP and Final Thoughts!

**Da Videos!**

The Videos come first this time, as I only did 2!:)  You can see my exploiting and demonstrating the amazing 3dSen Emulator on PC, and analyzing things in such a way to pull off some fun additions that one night not expect to work!  Within my current Release, in Xtras/MXYZPTLK/ is a 3dSen ReadMe, that I will Update in future Releases, with any and all Exploits or Additions I am able to work in, environmentally, or otherwise!  And, a showcase of the amazing Random Game Mode Activate, to top things off with the icing on the cake:)

**VVVVVV Fix Up! (Mini MD-S-NESC)**

VVVVVV is now 6 MB Smaller on Install.  The CLV is now CLV-G-VVVVVV to ensure there are no conflicts.  Delete the CLV-VVVVVV one.
Thanks for the heads up bslenul!  All good now:)

**Random Game Mode Activate! (Mini MD-S-NESC)**

As you can see in the above linked video, this is a truly beautiful addition!  When you are in a rut, and have a game on the tip of your tongue to play, but can't think of what to click...Let the amazing Random Game Mode Activate, courtesy of the scripting prowess of DanTheMan827, take charge, Roulette Style:)  It works most effectively and optimally with SNESC!  But, it should function quite nicely with MD/NES, as well.  If things work out, Dan may be able to touch things up to have more variables.  But, as is, it is a truly solid staple and will remain on my Main UI, along with RetroArch UI and Easy OC, as a permanent fixture!  Go ahead, try it out!  Note: if you are playing games where saves truly matter, it is probably best you load them the "old fashioned way".  This is meant more as a fun gimmick, to throw some randomness at you!  It is especially cool if you have thousands of games, and have no clue where to start!  My video shows some fun shenanigans, in any case!  Thanks again, Dan!

**Genesis Mini Classic (6 Button Fix! (Mini MD)**

Just a reminder, if using 6 Button Controller, you can now open RetroArch, Quick Menu, Controls, Load Mapper, Genesis Mini, 6 Button Fix:)

**Genesis Mini Classic (More Optimal RetroArch Exiting! (Mini MD)**

Due to popular demand and request, I did a quick touch up, so that you can easily tap Reset Button on your MD Mini ONCE, to Open RetroArch!  Twice, to immediately Exit RetroArch!  You can see me do it a few times in the Random Game Mode Activate Video!  This should please both audiences, as you can Stay or Go, Clash Style:)
Personal thanks to ReyVGM and jonnyOr for testing!

**PS4 Controller Fix! (Mini MD-S-NESC)**

Thank you bslenul for doing a quick patch up of incorrect mapping!  You simply rock, as always!  And, I know, many many many people will be most appreciative and less frustrated, as things will work more optimally!

**Nestopia Fixed! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Personal thanks to NESminiling0618 and cosmicpineapple (stand out user name, for sure:) for the heads up.  I quickly jumped onto fixing it for this Touch Up Release!

**Refresher Course on Mod Hub Games! (Mini MD-S-NESC)**

Don't forget to check out the 2 amazing Commodore 64 Collections on Mod Hub, that Requiem put together!  He had spent a ton of time putting these together.  Also, remember, after each game, restart the game in RetroArch Twice to be able to properly select from the list again!  Thanks Greenchili for helping test these fantastic games!  These will be absolutely always in my Main UI!  And, we will try to get even more homebrew games into the Next Update!  And, once you try these C64 Collections out, be sure to post a comment on which games you most enjoyed!   

**3D NES Games Possible on the Mini Classics?!**

Studio Geod did such a fantastic job with their amazing 3dSen emulator for PC.  I do a video showcase demonstration above in the YouTube Link.  You can see me do some fun exploitation of what I feel is a decent enough pattern of recognition asset wise!  And, it worked out, successfully, in a couple games.  I feel, once more of us experiment, we will get many more fun results!

As far as this working on the Mini Classics.  I am going to have to simply say, NO, not at all, for now.  It would take Studio Geod and any preexisting licensing agreements, whether Steam, or otherwise, to not be tied up...Plus, either their direct efforts and/or assistance, and of course, Open Source Code, is greatly helpful!  

In that respect, even DraStic should be Open Source enough for us to touch it up even further in fairly near future Releases!

For now, enjoy 3dSen, either on VR HeadSets, and/or PC!  But, in time, it may migrate, with a bit of work, to the Mini Classics!  Not to say that 3d Hacks cannot be made, however!  But, the amazing gimmick of Mode 7 like scaling and rotation, amongst other magic, is near untouchable!  I will also help anyone who needs assistance, running this as optimally, depending on what computer setups they are currently on!  It is a fairly cpu intensive application.  But, I will help Xtreme Mode Activate it, as much as possible, to help you all along!  I will also do many more videos, showcasing games people request to be seen.  And, I will try to see what I can do for best results as far as pseudo or near full fledged 3D, depending on whichever game!  Plus, more mappers can potentially be added, over time!  Thanks again for the amazing early year end gift, Studio Geod!  Much obliged! 

**WIP and Final Thoughts!**

I have gotten a crap ton of feedback since the Release.  I thank you all!  And, as far as WIP for Next Release, I will try to work in suggestions you all leave me in the comments on YouTube, Reddit, Discord, etc!  Enjoy this touch-up Update, and be sure to let me know what current games/tv/movies you are all checking out!  Always love good suggestions!  And, I will be in contact with screemer and Axanar of AutoBleem, as well as Genderbent of RetroBoot, and try to make sure we all have a nice collaborative Next Release, together!

**KM:)**

**06-21-2020**

  Hello Everyone!  Here we are again for yet another awesome Update!  We have games, we have Cores, we have fixes, we have everything but the kitchen sink!

  The world has been an absolutely crazy place over the last few months.  But, hey, when is it not!  That doesn't mean you all have to just stop enjoying life, clinging for fear and having anxiety over things to come, what is to be!  Good and bad have always existed.  You adapt, learn, progress, move forward, positive thinking wise!  In any case, I truly hope all of you are staying safe, and enjoying your lives as best as you possibly can...in a most harmonious way!

  I have tried to find the right balance between priorities, responsibilities, and personal enjoyment.  Between working and updating, I also tried to catch up on some more TV Shows and Movies, as well as play a few games.  Ozark, a Netflix show I initially passed right on by, thinking it wouldn't be that great...I checked it out, and ended up binge watching all 3 seasons.  Aside from Breaking Bad, other shows that were similarly binge worthy to me were ones such as Shield, Prison Break, Heroes, and so on.  The Writers' Strike occurred amidst the latter two, causing the overall quality to severely diminish in the final seasons...(kinda like Dexter and Game of Thrones!)

  And, lastly, I finished Ozark on Netflix, also a great show...especially if you like crime style dramas, on the edge of your seat dramas, like Breaking Bad!  I am now gonna finish up Future Man on Hulu, which is a fun, and very goofy show!  Shows that are just absolutely goofy are few and far between.  One I grew up with was called Get a Life, with Chris Elliott, heh.  And, I also loved Sledge Hammer!  In any case, let's get down to mod business!

**3D NES Games!? Can they run on the Mini Classics?**

Unfortunately, they would more than likely run as unoptimally as Mesen does on the Mini Classics!  And, similarly, Mesen has some incredible HD Sprite Replacement Games, along with Custom CD Soundtracks...such as with Metroid and Castlevania!  Mesen is incredible on PC.  I would love to see it run better on the Minis!  

3D wise, I played Metroid Cubed in 2003, of which Nintendo did a Cease and Desist Takedown Notice on!  I was thoroughly surprised and happy to see that the current 3dSen just got Released for Steam!  I will be doing videos on it, soon after this Update.  There are roughly 70 Supported NES games, with a bit of magic handling, have amazing 3d Effects!  You have to see it to believe it, and play it to truly comprehend!  Again, expect a video of this in action, probably later today, if not tomorrow:)  

As far as "this" kind of 3d running on ANY of the Mini Classics.  It is too intensive, cpu wise, and would run slow...unless a miracle happened!  So, for now, it is best enjoyed via PC or such!  Maybe, one day, however, the miracle of it working reasonably on the Minis would be nice.  But, do not expect it anytime soon!

**Requiem For A Mod Dream! (Mini MD-S-NESC)**

How many of you remember Requiem for a Dream, the movie!  I used to rent about any new movie that came out.  And, damn, that was quite a different kind of movie!  It verged on the oddball kind of stuff I would expect from a David Lynch film!  But, even to this day, I still vividly remember some of the crazy imagery that happened on screen!  Now that I think about it, the newer movie Horse Girl seems like might have a semblance of the weird that RFAD had!

In any case, will the "Real" Requiem stand up!  Requiem is a very cool, upstanding individual in the Mini Scene now.  I have been in contact with him for over a year now, via the various Venues I communicate with people on.  He kept suggesting and recommending games I try out, and vice versa.  And, of course, I tried to fix up things based on his feedback.  We started talking about "Homebrew" games, of which I have never really wanted to jump out of bed to just play!  But, tried and true, more and more of these games have been getting my attention!

Where does Requiem come into play, you might ask?  Well, he has painstakingly been seeking out and destroying...Had to do the Metallica reference!  Such a badass song! Pretty much since my last Update 2 months ago, he had been searching every nook and cranny of the internet for the best of the best Homebrews, for many different systems.  We started brainstorming a few ideas.  And, in the end, it culminated in him putting together 2 absolutely, phenomenal collections of Commodore 64 Games, which are NOW on the Mod Hub, via hakchi2 CE!  And, of course, those with PSC, if you watch my last video where I use Hakchi as a Game Manager for PSC!  (Maybe, one day, true support!), you can grab well over 100 games now, which will keep increasing each and every update!

Back to these 2 collections of Commodore 64 Homebrews!  You have roughly 50 or so great games, of many different genres, by several great enthusiasts who fan made them!  And, "MarcosGM", it even includes the Caveman Remake you kept asking me about getting the real version of working on MAME, which isn't easily done on the Minis!

Be sure to grab these 2 collections of games from the Games Tab, and enjoy hours and hours and hours of game play!  Try out I Wanna Flip The Sky, particularly, on the Action 53 Vol 1 for NES!...as it is a great companion piece to the Next Great thing in The Update!  VVVVVV!  Thanks again, Requiem, you have been an absolutely amazing part of the Homebrew Selection Process!  I sense more to come in future Updates!  

The Two Commodore 64 Collections.  After you play a game, go into RetroArch Settings, Restart Game Twice, so you can properly select another!

**VVVVVV...No, not the Cult Classic TV Mini-Series!:) (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

V was a great TV series, as well as Mini Series!  I loved the show as a kid, and even the remake roughly a decade ago!  There were action figures, comics, even some PC games based off of it.  And, Freddy Krueger was in it, before he turned evil:)

But, VVVVVV is as mindbendingly cool, gravity wise, as Inception!  And, yeah, very much looking forward to Nolan's upcoming movie!  That, and Top Gun will be fun movies this year.  Hell, I may even check out Wonder Woman, since the first standalone movie (Non-Justice League), was not too shabby.  And, I also see that a director's cut should be coming out of Justice League, which might be a great deal better.  Zak Snyder has done some fun movies before.  And, apparently, only 25 percent of his work was used in the final film.  He had to step down from the director's chair due to a tragedy in real life, unfortunately!  

Terry Cavanagh developed VVVVVV on a variety of platforms.  DanTheMan827 was a huge fan of one of his other games, Super Hexagon...By the way There is a Mini Version of Hexagon (albeit, with an epilepsy warning, due to the crazy flashing) on one of the C64 Collections Requiem put together!  Dan got things up and running, VVVVVV wise, for the MD/SNES/NES Classics!  You simply need to download the game from the Mod Hub, throw the data.zip into the CLV Folder.  data.zip can be gotten from the purchasable GOG or Steam Versions.  I am personally using the Steam Version, which can be grabbed for roughly 3 USD.  It is a masochistic game, that is incredibly addictive and fun to play.  You flip gravity to traverse the levels in very unique ways, with some fun puzzles along the route!  I did a video demonstration of the game in action!  And, of the time of this Release, Patton's take on the game, demonstration wise, should be up, or soon to be up!  And, I am sure he will also showcase some of the other fun games that pop up in this Release!  

Thor, of Retroguru, helped get VVVVVV up and running for the Playstation Classic.  And, I am indebted to him for the great efforts he has put forth on some other amazing homebrews, as well...which I am also very happily posting in the Release!  This works with AutoBleem, RetroBoot, my Xtreme Inector!  VVVVVV for PSC is in my PSC Folder, AB, RB_APPS, simply install the game to your Flash Drive, then navigate to Apps/vvvvvv/vvvvvv and copy data.zip there.  Then, push start on Main UI,  then push select a few times til you get to the Custom Apps, which will now have VVVVVV and any others you decide to install!  Some require you to add the game files, due to legal reasons, just like VVVVVV!  Try out Fruit-Y, Hermes, and SqRxZ 4 for PSC!  And, you can try out SqRxZ 1-4, Xump 1-2, Trap Runner, Super Nutmeg, Fred's Journey, for the other Minis!  Thanks again, all of you at Retroguru!  

And, Retroguru also worked on the fanmade Giana's Return, off of Great Giana Sisters!  There will be a nice definitive version of it coming out, due to their hard work and dedication!  And, we could probably expect this sometime in the fairly near future!  Giana games have always been fun, from the first time I played on Commodore 64 and Amiga!  They are also on Nintendo DS and Sony and Microsoft Systems.  Fun, slighly inspired by Mario 1.  But, there is enough awesome sauce in the games to carry their own weight!  Nintendo put a little pressure on the original developers, to get the first game removed from Store Shelves.  It worked, to a degree.  But, Giana became a cult classic, and is now here to stay!

**Retroguru! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

These guys are great, and have worked on roughly a good dozen+ amazing games.  Many of which are now in this Release!  Several you can get from the Mod Hub, and a few from the same spot VVVVVV is in, directly above!  

**Nestopia Sound Better Than Ever! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

You may have noticed, quite a few games had scratching sound with Nestopia...No More!  Thanks carmiker!

**Genesis Mini Classic Placeholder 6 Button Controller Fix! (Mini MD)**

Some of you with 6 Button MD Mini Controllers, may have noticed remapping tends to be off by +1!  We should be able to work towards a true fix, in the future.  But, with some great testing power and patience, both ReyVGM and myself have a placeholder fix for those of you who are tired of the frustration of accidentally pushing the wrong button and using your magic or power in games, such as Streets of Rage, etc!  Simply go into RetroArch Settings, Controls, Mapper, Load Mapper, Genesis Mini, 6 Button Fix!  It tests and works great. 

**Genesis Plus GX Sega CD Disk Swapping! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Yes, you can now swap disks for Sega CD, with Genesis Plus GX!  Simply go into RetroArch Settings, Disk Append, and select your disk, there.  Now, you can finally beat Night Trap and other such games on Genesis Plus GX!  This will not work on Genesis Plus Xtreme, for now!  Thanks so much Ekeeke!

**ScummVM Fixed Up! (Mini MD-S-NESC)**

You should be able to have no issues running games with /bin/scummvm as well as /bin/km_scummvm
Thanks to any and all who gave me feedback on problems loading a few games.

**gpSP RetroAchievements Fix! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

For those of you who are uninitiated, gpSP is a solid GBA Core that is fast and powerful.  Its main drawback is that it is not completely reliable with saves.  But, now, RetroAchievements should finally be fixed for the Core!

Thanks negativeExponent!

**RetroArch Xtreme Performance Touch-Ups for Amped/Ozone/RGUI! (Mini MD-S-NESC)**

Got quite a bit of feedback from over 100 people.  And, I touched up all 3 to have slightly better performance, without trading off too much stability and latency!  Remember, only install one RetroArch at a time!  Speaking of which, bslenul also helped with a nice coding addition to help properly push Amiga Saves to the folder they belong to.  You can view this and more info, whilst viewing the Core in hakchi!

**Playstation Classic Goodies! PS1 in HD! SNES at 60 FPS! FBNEO W/ColecoVision! (Mini PSC)**

Unfortunately, these are strictly for Playstation Classic, for now!  

PS1 in HD!  Yeah, this was no easy task.  Many games used to have bad stutter and/or be unplayable, while in HD Mode Activate!  After installing the Xtreme Injector, load up even R-Type Delta, a game that had issues before, and watch the magic happen!  And, of course, try many other games, even Ridge Racer!  I also updated special case scenario video plugin setups for Neon, Peops, Unai!  So, you have 4 nifty options to choose from!

Use Mednafen SNES Faust to run SNES games at 60 FPS, even with Rewind on!  SNES9x 2016-2018, and up lose 20 FPS, roughly, with Rewind enabled!  You also get an added perk of being able to run many FX Chip Games, like Star Fox, Yoshi's Island, Stunt Race FX, also at 60 FPS!  And, even Mega Man X1, 2 work great!  Fun fun Core!  Thanks Mednafen, for your helpful efforts with this amazing addition!  Thanks so much nl255, for helping test this great addition...And, having excellent attention to detail.  I can make improvements to it, as time progresses.  This is one can of whoop ass that is a Beast Mode Activate Core, without a doubt!

FBNEO is an amazing Arcade Core, nice companion piece to MAME.  I run both!  In any case, thanks to dinkc64 and Gab75, we have quite a few nifty homebrews for ColecoVision, as well as Team Pixelboy Games, working with direct load from FBNEO!  They must be inside a folder named coleco (case sensitive), along with the appropriate Coleco Bios.  coleco.zip  Greenchili and myself have put efforts into getting many of these coded in last year.  Dinkc64 was nice enough to push some of the coding, and add to the awesomeness, for even more games!  I was happy with Dragon's Lair SGM and Buck Rogers SGM!  But, now, you can run over 40+ games, as well as many more!  I will do more videos of this, as well as help any of you that need assistance running these.  You are also welcome to ping or pm me on our Discord!  And, if you check back periodically, you may see a surprise or few turn up inside Xtras/MXYZPTLK, in my Release!  So, anyone who wants to run these, or has trouble running them, simply let me know!  And, we will go from there! Coleco Via FBNEO will be a priority for me to do more info and help you all run.  I just ran a little short on time, so will follow-up right after Release with more of this magic!  Just don't forget to refresh the MXYZPTLK folder!  This will be the next priority, along with getting some 3d NES Videos up!  Also, Requiem did a nice little compilation of Team Pixelboy Cheats, for the Coleco Games, which I threw in Xtras/MXYZPTLK!  Other fun stuff may show up there, this week, too!  Just keep refreshing, and maybe, just maybe, you will see some goodies pop in!  Thanks again Greenchili, dinkc64, Gab75, and all else involved!

**Commodore Amiga/64/Vic-20 All Accounted For, and better than ever!**

Thanks Sonninnos and RSN8887, per usual!  And, I also did what I could to help improve things on the Mini Classics.  Games now load Warp Speed Ahead, automatically!  Try Fix it Felix, as an example, especially the slower C64 Formats!  Additionally, did some sprucing up, and you can...on the Minis (aside from PSC), use these command lines.../bin/c64, /bin/c128, and /bin/vic20  ! Vic-20 is fun.  I would recommend trying homebrew games first, as some of the retail games do not yet work!  But, things are getting better each update!  Have tried quite a few in my schedule, when not working!  And, a personal thanks to MadFranko008 for some of the incredible wealth of Commodore Knowledge he has continually passed along!  It has helped give some fun ideas of things to mess with, Core wise!

I also did a new tutorial on my YouTube, to cover "Legal" BIOS.  I also did some personal testing, and matched up all of the "out in the wild" MD5 Checksums, with their appropriate names, too!  You can see this information, in Xtras, Amiga, Direct Load txt.  Scroll all the way down, for BIOS MD5s for both sets of Forever Amiga BIOS, as well as the "Out in the Wild" ones!  And, don't be a stranger, if you ever need assistance!  Many of you have already come to me, and are now playing Amiga "Forever", literally:)

**What the hell is going on with the Turbografx-16 Mini!? (PCE Mini)**

You may be wondering, when the hell is this thing gonna be hacked in a way that the public can use it, user friendly wise!  Don't get your hopes up, too soon.  It is a tricky system to work with, as entering FEL mode, like with the other Minis (requiring power+reset), is not possible the same way on the TG-16 Mini!  There is no Reset Button!  The Reset, even on the real hardware, was on your controller!  select+start!  Sound familiar?  There are some great people picking at the system.  But, with all the crazy stuff going on in the world, true dedication, day in and day out, may not be as easily a goal, as was when we were all doing MD Mini, SNES Mini, and so on!  No matter the case, be patient, be careful if someone DOES release a modification...as, it can potentially be risky.  If you screw up the Uboot, you would typically have to take the system apart to fix it!

**Closing Notes!**

It has been a crazy and wild ride, this year!  Who would have ever thought 2020 would be like what many felt 2000 would have been!  Hopefully, things smooth out, in the future...And, harmony happens to a degree!  We can all just try our best!  Keep pushing forward, positive forward thinking!

DanTheMan827, who of course works on Hakchi2 CE, has also gotten into another thing we have chatted about in the past...Squashing files to even smaller sizes!  Expect some examples of these for the MD/SNES/NES Classic, in likely the Next Release!  Some test examples, potentially can drop in size, 7 MB, at a fair low, to over 100 MB+ at a high!  Just needs some testing to ensure all rolls out smoothly!

Requiem also did the Custom Arts for several of the newest Game Additions to Mod Hub.  I, of course, had to do a little editing, getting them to proper dimensions, and all that fun stuff, for appropriate display!  Also check out the little animation for VVVVVV when viewed in the Mod Hub!  I may get more demonstrations like these up, in the Next Release!

I will also work towards trying to have games for nearly every Core, available, on Mod Hub!

As I type this last section, I have succeeded in working in maximum overdrive, doing my double shifts at work, as well as finishing up the Update, trying to help troubleshoot others, as well as take care of real life responsibilities.  Many of you have already reported to me that now, with the lockdown not being as bad, you are taking a long needed vacation!  Well, I can say it first...Enjoy it!  Try to really grab the moment, and just have fun for a little bit, rather than letting despair take hold, with the world situation!  Things will get better, you will get better, you will see!  

See you Next Time!  And, in between!  And, remember...Once I get a little sleep, I will be back in action with more videos, and even MORE WIP Updating!  

And, looking forward to the feedback, as well as catching up on all of your many messages!  

**PS** I have also communicated with Genderbent.  And, once he is done with his mini vacation, he should be back to getting another kickass RetroBoot together, complete with a new RetroArch!  We have decided to not jump right onto the newest ones, without some extensive testing.  1.7.8 and on, have had various fun factors to contend with.  1.8.4 is quite good, at the moment.  1.8.5 became 1.8.6 became 1.8.7, quite fast.  Typically, a new RetroArch Release would be 6 months, give or take...unless issues "butterfly mod effect" arise.  Butterfly Mod Effect is a part of any development process.  You gotta break a few eggs to create an omelette, metaphorically speaking!  But, in any case, Libretro is doing a tremendous job, as well as we all are attempting to bring more and more future nostalgic awesomeness to you all!

  I have been catching up on a few TV Shows, Movies, etc, lately.  Huge Horror and Sci-Fi Fan.  But, also thoroughly enjoy Comedies.  On Netflix, have started watching Trailer Park Boys.  Like with Breaking Bad and Big Bang Theory, at face value, I watched one episode and went, bleh.  But, later on, gave them all another chance, and found them "binge worthy".  I am also watching Derry Girls.  I just finished up Sex Education.  And, the Scottish Comedy show, Still Game is very funny, if you are into oddball humor!  Found a decent Spanish Horror flick, called The Platform.  Horror seems to be few and far between, nowadays!  Just like how Zombie Films/TV were fairly obscure at certain points!  But, with Walking Dead, it has had a revival!  Hopefully, something really brings the H back into the Horror Game!  Green Inferno is a pretty crazy one on Netflix, too!  Eli Roth FTW!  And, as always, love any recommendations any of you have, too!

I DO have the TurboGrafx 16 Mini.  I will do videos with it, after this Update is posted.  So, be sure to check out my YouTube Channel:)  

**04-27-2020**

So much has happened in the time since the last Release!  The entire world, as we know it, has changed!  I truly hope all of you are staying safe in this scary scenario.  This isn't the first time in history, nor will it be the last.  But, not giving up and pushing through, hopefully things will work out in a positive way so everyone can maintain a semblance of normalcy.  Most definitely do not embrace bleakness.  Instead, try to see the light that paves a forward future!

Moving on, many new things make this Update, which will harken back to the nostalgic side in many of you!

**Hakchi2 CE 3.8.0! (Mini MD-S-NESC)**

Every Update I post tries to be as harmonious a companion to the amazing Hakchi2 CE, as possible!  You can see a whole new host of fixes, changes, adjustments, and additions...courtesy of the fantastic hard work and dedication of the invariably awesome team of Madmonkey and DanTheMan827 and company, AKA Team Shinkansen!  Latest changes, including more refined Bluetooth and Scraper Support can be reviewed at:

https://github.com/TeamShinkansen/hakchi2/releases/

There is also some truly incredible artwork, courtesy of TheWez1981 and CaptSNES AKA Nar! You can utilize within hakchi for Folders, and such!  In Xtras, Hakchi, CaptSNES_AKA_Nar!, is a great set-up you can use with hakchi!  I am a tremendous fan of the Marvel Masterpieces Cards that have been put out over the years.  And, Nar! has personally worked on some of these, as well as others!  Get ready to drool over the Masterpieces of Icon Awesome Imagery that both of these guys have brought forth upon us!  TheWez1981's are incorporated directly into hakchi.  Nar's should be Next Update!  But, you can manually add his, for now!   

**AutoBleem/RetroBoot/Xtreme Injector Updated! (Mini PSC)**

AutoBleem (0.9.0) now has Bluetooth AND Wi-Fi AND Custom Kernel Support, amongst many many other changes.  Way to go Screemer, Axanar, and the rest of the AutoBleem Team!  I can only say, personally, on my end...testing has been absolutely fantastic with the new additions!  And, both Genderbent's RetroBoot (1.1) and my Xtreme Injector have been updated as well!  

The Cores I work with are part of RetroBoot and AutoBleem and Xtreme Injector.  RetroBoot and AutoBleem favor Stability and Latency.  I add a few additional things to the Xtreme Injector that favor Performance and Speed.  As time progresses, and these prove stable enough, some of these may be added to future RB/AB Releases!  This was my original intent, to always test run experimental changes, then apply them to Stable Releases, once they work out!  It has been working out so nicely, with the overall collaboration and pure awesomeness of all involved!  Genderbent's RetroBoot and Screemer and Company's AutoBleem Releases are linked at top of my main Github, as hard links.  My Xtreme Injector can be gotten from PSC Folder within the Release, as well as from my G Drive Link!  

**MAME 2003 Xtreme Mode Activate! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

  I have been playing around with MAME since its first Release by Nicola Salmoria in 1997!  Some of the first games that really got my attention were Sly Spy (Data East) and Michael Jackson's Moonwalker.  I had to run these via Command Prompts since there really wasn't a GUI initially.  And, when I got source, I was able to compile it into a GUI later on.  I started playing around with the various drivers, changing things to try to run these things better on my Windows 98 Computer.  And, I never looked back.  I mostly focused on PC.  But, later branched out into other platforms, such as PSP, and even Android.  But, now, my primary focus is with the Mini Classics!  That is the true Nostalgic Home Base!  

  I barely have enough room in my basement for a 3/4 sized Pool Table.  And, I even had to get a smaller cue stick, for side shots!  But, I DO have a Pirates of the Caribbean Zizzle Pinball Table that is pretty bad-ass, that I got on clearance for 50 USD.  Kind of wish I bought two of them at the time, as it is a pretty well designed machine, albeit with the known "power source port" going bad and "smaller than usual" flippers.  But, smaller flippers equals more challenge!

  Getting back to the subject at hand...in 2017 when the NES Classic came out, I quickly chose MAME 2003 as my absolute favorite Core of them all!  I then embarked on a mission to get as many things as possible fixed up!  In that time, I have met and collaborated with many great people from MAME, including Arcadez2003, Grant2258, and Markwkidd, as well as worked with Gpstar81 and BigBlueFrontEnd (Custom OSTs).  Performance and Speed has been the name of the game for me from the get go!  When I was posting Releases, I would get feedback on games that had issues, such as In the Hunt having Freddy Krueger "chalk board" noises, such as in THIS Video I posted showcasing the glitchy bug, before getting it perm fixed in MAME 2003 Xtreme!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRjyl4GY09U

Suffice to say, the Butterfly Mod Effect is a thing!

**Butterfly Mod Effect (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Butterfly Mod Effect is a term I coined to be a play on Ashton Kutcher's Movie, which was a great film...as well as the overall idea that changing one thing can either make or break another!  In the case of Butterfly Mod Effect, there were quite a few instances where it worked in favor of helping fix other things!  Such as with In the Hunt and other Irem Sound Game glitch fixes, it also helped fix Nintendo Vs. Games, such as Vs. Duck Hunt, Vs. Super Mario Bros., etc!  You can see how absolutely god awful Duck Hunt was when I first worked with it, here!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnKKOQeJwJ4&t=5s

Not only was Duck Hunt awful in sound.  But, it was absolutely unplayable due to control issues.  So, then, more fairly recently...I had this idea to try to get Hard Drivin' fixed up.  I talked to Grant2258 about this, and as a Butterfly Mod Effect result, Analog Control implementation also finally helped make Duck Hunt and other Light Gun games more controllable, as well as even games like Hang On and Super Hang On!  There are dozens upon dozens of instances where things would parlay directly into other fixes!  Even with System 32, I saw the games were crashing.  But, they were at least displaying the "warning" disclaimers before doing so.  So, I tried a few changes to the Sega Drivers, which actually helped SpiderMan Arcade work!  Like, here:)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf0dTFLIWKY

It became quite the challenge...As, fixing one thing could help fix another, as well as break another!  I had to temporarily separate coding for System 32, til I got a few other things fixed up!

This applies to many Cores, not just MAME 2003 Xtreme!  But, as things come to my attention, I do my best to collaborate and get them fixed up, despite the drama I had undergone which tried to detract me from the end goal of trying to help all of you more fully enjoy your nostalgia!  I will cover more of these changes in the future, as well as in videos.  But, never ever hesitate to let me know something that may have an issue, as I will definitely see what can be done about it.  And, those I have collaborated with have been amazing in helping out in an all around better package for everyone!  Let's go over some NEW MAME 2003 Xtreme Additions!  Speaking of which, a completely broken game Butterfly Mod Effected its way into this next Addition (Discs of Tron; broken controls, mirror imaged graphics, nonauthentic artwork display, and timing issues which prevented the game from even loading to begin with!)

**MAME 2003 Xtreme Authentic Artwork! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

You may have played Discs of Tron in the Arcade, or only via Emulator.  But, you may not have realized how unauthentic the Emulator Version was due to the magic of how they did a backdrop with mirrors in the Arcade Version!  You can install, for MD/SNES/NES, Hakchi, Modules, KMFD Mod Hub, KMFD Xtras, RA Art MAME 2003 Xtreme, in conjunction with MAME 2003 Xtreme Core...to have amazingly real and authentic Arcade Backdrops for a ton of games!  Thanks to any and all who have worked on these over the years!  For PSC, you can simply install the Xtreme Core Injector!  I fixed several, personally.  And, I can add more on request!  These include:

**Note: Several of the above require Sound Samples, which can be installed via the RA Arcade Custom Samples HMOD for MD/SNES/NES.  PSC, simply copy the appropriate samples into system/mame2003-xtreme/samples**

Custom OSTs are installed the "Exact" same way!

**MAME 2003 Xtreme Annoying Controls Fixed! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Hundreds of games had predeterminate controls that were associated and attributed to keyboard configuration.  This doesn't necessarily help us on pesky games, such as Xybots, Ikari Warriors, Forgotten Worlds, etc, which need Rotary Controls!  So, then, I decided I really wanted to get these all fixed up!  Now, with MAME 2003 Xtreme, Rotary Controls are auto assigned to L1/R1, respectively!  These include:

- Bermuda Triangle
- Caliber 50
- Downtown
- Drift Out
- Exterminator
- Forgotten Worlds
- Front Line
- Gondomania
- Guerilla War
- Heavy Barrel
- Ikari Warriors
- Ikari Warriors II: Victory Road
- Ikari Warriors III
- Midnight Resistance
- SAR Search and Rescue
- Time Soldiers
- Tin Star
- TNK 3
- TNK III
- Top Gunner (Jackal)
- Touchdown Fever
- Tournament Arkanoid
- Wild Western
- Xybots

And, many more!  Practically any game that needs L1/R1 now utilizes it by default!  Enjoy!  And, thank you Grant2258 for helping with this amazing implementation, and Mavis99 for pushing me to get this done!

Additionally, Most Racing Games are far more intuitive now with Acceleration being planted firmly to the R1 Button, and Slowing Down onto L1!  Everything is hard coded, so no messy configurations.  And, a fresh install will always stick to these amazing control fixes!  Any other games any of you can think of that need controls fixed, be sure to let me know!  And, I will see what I can do with them!

Speaking of control issues!

**MAME 2003 Xtreme 720 Degrees of Sonic the Hedgehog Awesomeness! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

The Unreleased Version of SegaSonic the Hedgehog Arcade, just so happens to be a game that not only did not work in the past.  But, it also had quite broken controls, due to the fact that it utilized a trackball!  It was nearly impossible to play with a controller!  I thought about things when a few requested I look into the game.  And, now, it controls near flawlessly with a controller on MAME 2003 Xtreme!  And, then:)  720 Degrees, a fantastic skateboarding game that revolved around trying to do stunts, such as rotating 720 Degrees in the air...I found one could not easily pull off 720s!  Things are now fixed up in such a way that you can pull off 720s with a far less degree of difficulty!

**MAME 2003 Xtreme PGM PolyGame Master Games Implemented! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

pgm.zip BIOS required in same directory as PGM Games!  Thanks so much Arcadez2003, for helping fix things up with this awesome subset of Arcade Sweetness!  You can now play the following games in their full grandeur!:

- DoDonPachi Black Label Edition
- ESPGal
- Killing Blade
- Knights of Valour (Now Has Sound!)
- Oriental Legend (Now Has Sound!)
- Photo Y2K
- PuzzleStar

You can see several of these in action in my video section at end of this Release!

**MAME 2003 Xtreme Bootstram Nvram Initialization Process Mode Activate! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

The Mini MD/SNES/NES only have 256 MB of onboard RAM.  This can be very difficult and taxing when it comes to running certain, more intensive Games/Cores.  PSC has 1 GB of RAM, in contrast!  So, not as much a problem!  In any case, 2 specific games were quite unstable as far as even loading and/or even functioning, without hassle.  These 2 are the fantastic Gaiapolis and Monster Maulers!  Much like with the earlier fixed game, Run 'n Gun by Konami, which markwkidd helped with a bootstramp nvram implementation for...I did a fairly similar thing by having these auto initialize with MAME 2003 Xtreme and RetroArch Xtreme on MD/SNES/NES and Xtreme Injector and MAME 2003 Xtreme on PSC!)  SO so much better, now!  Don't forget to try 2 Player Mode Activate!

Taking this one step further!:

**MAME 2003 Xtreme Terminator 2/Revolution X! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Nothing is more irritating than getting a game to load, then finding out you can't control it!  Such as with the case with Terminator 2 and Revolution X, two very great On Rails Light Gun Games!  With RetroArch Xtreme and MAME 2003 Xtreme Combo, they should be auto initialized for you, now!  And, on PSC, simply install the Xtreme Injector!  I will calibrate other games, for future Releases!  

**FPS Awesomeness with Wolfenstein 3D! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Wow, for those of you who love FPS Games, one of the very first ones of its kind, Wolfenstein 3D, can now be played in its full glory, with the ECWolf Core!  You can also run Wolfenstein: Spear of Destiny, as well as Noah's Ark!  I have taken the liberty of putting Wolfenstein 3D Shareware Game onto Mod Hub, Games Tab!  Thanks to all who have ever worked on ECWolf, as well as the original Wolf4SDL, AND the actual Wolfenstein Games!  And, thank you phcoder and company for your amazing work with the Libretro Port!

**FPS Awesomeness with Marathon Trilogy! (Mini PSC)**

Genderbent did an absolutely phenomenal job porting over the entire Marathon Trilogy, made by Bungie, pre-Halo Fame, for Macs!  They can easily be installed with the RetroBoot Patches inside PSC, Apps Folder!  Simply install AutoBleem/RetroBoot/or Xtreme Injector, then extract patches you would like installed to outset of drive.  Then, boot into RetroArch to have them display message they are installing!  Then, go to Main UI, push start, then select til you get to the Apps Screen!  You can run OpenBor, and DraStic, etc, this way, too!  Be sure to check out the great port of Shadow Warrior Genderbent moved on over to the PSC, side, as well!  You will need the legal game files, as in ReadMe, to run that one!  I will do Demonstration/Tutorial, when I get a moment, too!  Also, OpenTyrian, a personal fave SHMUP of mine, Genderbent, ALSO got done!  Many more Game Ports to come in the future!    

**SHMUP Awesomeness with Xenon 2 (Mini MD-S-NESC)**

I added a great Demo of Xenon 2 to Mod Hub, within Hakchi!  You will need BIOS installed, including the WHDLoad HMOD, in order to play it!  BIOS Information is detailed in next section!

**P-UAE Xtreme Awesomeness CDTV Support!**

Thank You RSN8887 and Sonninnos for their, per usual, incredible efforts with Commodore and Amiga!  This time around, focus is on Amiga for the Release.  Next time, I will further fix up Commodore!  But, Amiga Wise, you will notice better performance and speed, as well as ability to run CDTV Games, much like CD32 from Last Release!  You Amiga Purists will immediately see the differences between the last few Releases and this one!  Everything, all around, is far superior to before!  I will keep doing what I can to maintain excellent performance and speed on the Mini Classic front for the tough to run Amiga P-UAE Xtreme Core!

**BIOS Wise, you will need:**

- MD/SNES/NES: Install via RA Master BIOS Module, in conjunction with WHDLoad BIOS HMOD!
- PSC: Copy BIOS to system, and have AutoBleem, RetroBoot, or Xtreme Injector Installed!

**BIOS Configuration (All go in system)**

- P-UAE CD32/CDTV = kick40060.CD32, kick40060.CD32.ext (Amiga CD32); kick34005.CDTV (Amiga CDTV)

- P-UAE Xtreme = kick34005.A500 (Amiga 500), kick40063.A600 (Amiga 600), kick40068.A1200 (Amiga 1200), WHDLoad.hdf (Again, WHDLoad HMOD for MD/SNES/NES; AB/RB/Xtreme Injector for PSC!)

Enjoy!  Game is absolutely amazing!

P.S.: There is a little trick you can do to force CDTV, CD32 Games, etc!  Simply have them in a folder named CDTV or CD32, or have those as part of the game name!  IE: Xenon_2_CD32  More will be done with this smart recursive searching, Next Release!

**NES Slowdown Be Gone! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

This is something I had toyed with in the past, as it greatly helps out on games, such as Contra Force, which ran awful as can be on the original hardware, for whichever reason or another!  Rushed Xmas Release!?  Who really knows! Might have to further research this one, Johnny 5 Short Circuit Style for "More Info!"  Kind of interesting how both Wall-E and the other movie, Chappie, that had Die Antwoord, were both highly reminiscent of Short Circuit!  Imagine if they ever did a remake of the original!  I even liked Short Circuit 2, which kind of reminded me of Crocodile Dundee 2, in taking the main protagonist to an entirely new environment!

In any case, to outright avoid screwing things up and causing conflicts, you can NOW run on MD/SNES/NES, 

/bin/fceumm-xtreme to run NES games with little or no slowdown; /bin/fceumm for normal hardware!

On PSC, simply load the appropriate Core!

P.S.  Good luck beating Gradius, muahahaha:)

**MD/SMS Slowdown Be Gone! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Same as with NES, you can now use with MD/SNES/NES

/bin/genesis-xtreme-gx to run MD/SMS games with little or no slowdown; /bin/genesis-plus-gx for normal!

For PSC, simply load the respective Core!  Enjoy Sonic Spinball and many more, in a much much better way!  In fact, try Sonic Spinball ON normal hardware perimeters with Genesis-Plus-GX.  Then, try it with Xtreme, for a night and day difference!  Many other games benefit, too!  Speaking of which!...

**SMS FM Mode Activate! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

As an added bonus, you can run SMS Games with FM Mode Activate, with 9 additional channels of amazing, synthesizer quality sound (peripheral on original system Released to Support this...As well as a redesigned Japan Only System!), with Xtreme GX by default!  Games that support this (4 need Patched) include:

**SNES Slowdown Be Gone! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

It is fairly common knowledge that quite a few SNES Games suffered inordinate Slowdown, such as Gradius III, Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts, Super R-Type, etc, on the original hardware.  And, Emulation Wise, due to the complicated nature of the special FX Chips, games such as Yoshi's Island and Star Fox have been problematic!  With this Release, you can opt for running like original hardware.  Or, you can take them to more Xtreme Proportions, with even FX being fixed up to be a yeah but no affair, like Little Britain (overclocked, underclocked!)

MD-SNES-NES wise, you can run with /bin/snes10-xtreme for Xtreme Mode Activate, little or no slowdown!
To run normal hardware, just run with /bin/snes10

PSC wise, simply load the proper Core! Also, on PSC, is an Xtreme Amped Version, which will slightly help even more with Gradius III, Super R-Type, etc.  Note, the Amped Version is less compatible with other games.  Contra 3 will NOT work with it.  I only set this up for PSC, since direct load is easier to switch over to Xtreme or Standard from, than those who run almost primarily from Main UI on MD/SNES/NES.  And, as a result, they would be far more likely to get many more game crashes.  Maybe, once things pan out, and I update further, I will get Amped onto MD/SNES/NES, too.  But, it is more realistically optimal for PSC, for the time being!

**FB NEO UniBios Updated to Epic Proportions! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

With Latest Update, you can now merge your neogeo.zip BIOS with 4.0 Unibios!  This allows for many more Cheats and other such fun fixes, including Fun Physics with SNK Vs Capcom Chaos!  You will need to select UniBios in Core Options, then use the 3 button shortcut (generally whichever would be considered A, B, C, simultaneously on your controller...to pull up UniBios Special Menu, "when and after you see UniBios" splash screen!  You can do a whole multitude of amazing feats and great things with Cheats, etc, once you are in said Special Menu, and apply them!  Enjoy!  Personal thanks to dinkc64 and the rest of the FB NEO Team for making this possible, as well as those who have worked on and created the amazing UniBios!

**RetroArch Xtreme Amped! (Mini MD-S-NESC)**

I have progressively become more and more experimental, and opted to go mostly a Performance and Speed Based Route.  You will see 3 RetroArch Versions for MD/SNES/NES.  One is Xtreme Amped, which is my personal build for Performance and Speed, with cost of Latency and Stability as a trade-off.  Then, there is Ozone, which has good Latency and Stability.  And, finally, RGUI, which is good with Latency, and loads games "instantly, or near instantly".  Amped and Ozone are more attractive Main User RetroArch UI.  RGUI uses less resources and assets, so can load games faster.  In any case, If you favor Latency, and are less concerned with Performance and Speed, run with either Ozone or RGUI!  If you want to push Games/Cores to more bleeding edge, run with Xtreme Amped.

For PSC, if you want better Latency and Stability, use RetroBoot or AutoBleem.  If Performance and Speed, use Xtreme Injector.  I will throw up a new Video Tutorial on Xtreme Injector Installation!

In any case, you have some great path choices you can partake in.  Amped will help you run Sega Saturn, Dreamcast, PSP, MAME, FBA, slightly better, as well as run more PS1 Games in HD Mode Activate!  Xtreme will be more adaptable for Speed Running!

Of course, "some" games simply run like garbage to begin with.  I have left in some fixes on these ones, as they are otherwise unplayable without them!  I will do more Updating in future releases!  

**Other Notes & WIP**

I will work with Commodore 64, Nintendo Power, a few other oddball Requests, as well as get more Games onto Mod Hub for MD/SNES/NES.  Cores Updated for THIS Release, are dated April 27th in Mod Hub for the preceding systems.  Many fixes, changes, updates, additions.  I have already spent quite a bit, writing up practically a novella with some of the additions noted above!  I will do follow-up Videos, etc, covering others that made the cut, per usual!  Also, for THIS Release, P-UAE Xtreme RetroArch AND Suspend Saves should be fixed, and have tested fine on my end for MD/SNES/NES/PSC!  And, more In Game Saves should be fixed up for those who choose to use gpSP GBA Core.  Again, so many things to cover.  You will discover many of these yourself when testing and enjoying and having fun with this current Update!  And, I will follow-up with you all in PMs, YouTube, Reddit, etc., messages, as well.  Communication will help with fixing up and adding things for the very Next Update!   MAME 2003 Xtreme will get another Update, too!

And, for MD/SNES/NES, there is a nifty HMOD on Mod Hub for those who do NOT want to keep saves, thanks to DanTheMan827.  Meant for "Ride Along Passengers", and such!  It will wipe saves each Reboot!

Added a Cheat Database 2020 to the Xtras/MXYZPTLK Folder!  Thanks to all who have worked on that!

The Bluetooth HMOD is also Updated!
