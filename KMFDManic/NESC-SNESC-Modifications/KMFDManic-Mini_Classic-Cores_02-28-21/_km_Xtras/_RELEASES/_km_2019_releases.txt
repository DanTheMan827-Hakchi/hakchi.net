**a few people are still using --smooth43 instead of --enable-smooth so bslenul re-included it, so you can use both now (for RA and Canoe)**

Personal thanks to CompCom for helping out with a RetroArch Bug that affected Wayland on PSC.  And, Genderbent, for his exceptional RetroArch and RetroBoot efforts!  And, of course, Madmonkey, for helping with RetroArch on MD-S-NESC!  And, both DanTheMan827 and Madmonkey for making Hakchi2 CE better, every single day!

Read the 11-26-19 Notes below, for the rest of what went into the Latest Release!

P.S. Next Up, will get a ton more games, including OpenBOR ones, up and posted:)

Disney Plus!?  Guess 10 Million Plus of us are suckers for Disney!  Mandalorian truly is a fun watch, even though it does have elements of Guardians of the Galaxy, John Wick, and countless other preordained sci-fi and actioner affairs!  Very much looking forward to Chapter 4!  

And, not surprisingly enough, the latest John Rambo movie truly kicks ass.  It has a nice mixture of violence and drama and Sylvester is as fun to watch as he was in First Blood!  I still personally think Ikari Warriors is loosely based off of his character!  

Binge watching!  What shows or movies have you binge watched lately?  Personally, my significant other and myself flew through all 3 seasons of Atypical, which is...ironically enough, about an individual who has Aspergers, which is a form of higher functioning autism.  This may or may not surprise you all.  But, I also have Aspergers, or as Cartman would say...Assburgers!  So, if you ever watch The Good Doctor, Atypical, even Big Bang Theory, you will see some of the general personality and traits I have in those Autistic Characters.  

**Now then!**

I am not planning on Updating Google Drive until tomorrow!  So, keep that in mind.  You will only be able to get these from the Main Release 7z Assets way way below for PSC-MD-S-NESC, or Mod Hub via Hakchi for MD-S-NESC!  Unfortunately, I am short on time before work.  So, it will be top priority to fully update Google Drive Link tomorrow!!!

**SEGAAAA Saturn FTW! (Mini PSC ONLY!)**

Sega Saturn NOW can run full speed on Many Games!  This is ONLY possible on PSC, and will probably never work on any of the other Mini Classics, such as the MD-S-NESC, unfortunately!  It is what it is.  So, naysayers who bashed PSC from day one, this is yet another reason why the system is a true Modder's Paradise!  

Games, such as Guardian Heroes run near flawlessly, with 3d Games like Panzer Dragoon Zwei, Saga, and Nights running quite admirably!  Like Sega Dreamcast and N64 and PSP, there is a vast variety to the overall performance and speed, which is quite case by case.  I went through a ton of testing over the last several weeks, and got many things cleaned up for a very stable Release!  Compatibility wise, I am mostly concerned with games that you all run into that do not work.  Those will be the main ones that I focus on trying to fix up in future Updates...!  

Ironically enough, going through "unofficial" means was the key to achieving this amazing performance and speed!  I give huge and tremendous personal thanks to devMiyax for his efforts with this pure awesomeness!  Shinobi Legions is one game that I have wanted to be able to emulate properly on the Mini Classics for almost 3 years now!  Very happy, right now:)  Also, thanks to madmonkey and special test credits to shantigilbert (who gave some incredible spec differentials that greatly helped out with this side project, once thought to just be a pipedream for our Mini Classics!)  Shantigilbert also works with the Amlogic platform, which is one of the ONLY ways of running 3DO FULL SPEED AHEAD at this current time and place!  Like Sega Saturn, there "is" a possibility we may one day get near to full speed 3DO and Atari Jaguar.  But, don't expect it anytime soon!  

For now, I would absolutely love any and all feedback you all have on games you test, whether they work well, great, perfectly, not at all, with glitches, and so on!

BIOS ARE required to run the Core, which is Yabause Xtreme when you load the games.  The prerequisite BIOS are saturn_bios.bin (case sensitive!), which can be copied and pasted into retroarch/system

**SEGAAAA Saturn Xtras! (Mini PSC)**

On my Google Drive Link, in Xtras/Game Art & Thumbnails, you can get amazing 3d Box Art (Thanks Robin55 and EM!) for the Saturn Games.  Just simply have them named same as the games, and in same folder, if loading content.  Scrolling through them will display the "last" activated artwork box!  This will work most optimally if using the AutoBleem Xtreme Core Injector in my set, with the set-up I post.  Additionally, if you "scan" for Sega Saturn games, via file or directory, you can copy the Sega Saturn thumbnails to retroarch/thumbnails/ and you will see a combination of glorious box art and/or in game screen shots!

**SEGAAAA Saturn Compatibility Fixes WIP! (Mini PSC)**

The FIRST game which really irked me, that didn't initially work, was able to be fixed up with a clever workaround which ignores things, and runs it in debug mode perimeters!  With the Xtreme Injector for AutoBleem installed, simply have your game file named as Astal, and it "should work decently" enough to be playable.  It is a beautiful game, just unfortunately not full speed!  Personal thanks to Sal X for the recommended fix method for Astal!

**SEGAAAA Saturn Tutorial! (Mini PSC)**

In Xtras/Tools/CHDMAN, use the V5, and simply double click the batch file, whilst the games you want to convert to chd are inside said folder!  This will convert bin+cue Sega Saturn games into sometimes up to 75 percent smaller CHD files, nearly equivalent to 7zip in size!!!  Enjoy the great space saving!

I will do more advanced Tutorials for other non-bin+cue formats!

**Easy Overclock! (Mini S-NESC!)**

This was oft requested, and bslenul made it happen.  You don't even need Xtreme Overclock installed!  Hakchi/Modules/KMFD Mod Hub/Games Tab, download and add as a game!  Once you open it from wherever you have it on Mini SNES-NES (for now), you can Overclock and Declock at will!  It is an amazing addition, and thanks Bslenul!

**Easy RPG Non-English Games! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Thanks to Ghabry, we can now play Non-English games!  Polish, Spanish, Russian, and so on, as Fonts are supported!  A few people have asked me about this in the past.  But, now it is a reality!  Thanks Ghabry!  And, thanks bslenul for testing!

**DOSBox SVN Performance+Speed Boost! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Thanks fr500 and the rest of the DOSBox SVN Team for helping make DOS even better than ever before.  A ridiculous amount of fixes, changes, updates, which I will cover in a follow-up video!

**Amiga Improved Yet Again! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

rsn8887 and sonninnos have been quite active with C64 and AMIGA, and both Cores are so so so much better.  Again, I will do follow-up videos on these.  I also did some coding changes, too, and made things more optimal for our Mini Classics.  Select button can now easily be used to toggle between Mouse/Joypad!  This is absolutely necessary for some "trainer" games!  Thanks Jul Car and Game Cleaner for helping test!!!

**Hakchi MD Mini WIP! (Mini MD)**

Madmonkey and DanTheMan827 have done quite a bit, forward moving wise, with MD Mini!  Main UI Injection will most definitely be coming in the near future!  Just be patient, everyone!  And, TheWez1981 has been gracious enough to help out with the needed Spine Arts, to complete the amazing awesomeness!

**WIP! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Working in some more Arcade Related stuff, Next Update, as well as potentially hundreds of new games to the Mod Hub and Google Drive Links!

**By request, PSC Xtreme Core Injector added for BleemSync! (Mini PSC!)**

Been requested nearly 500 times.  So, for those of you who love BS, I added the Injector, Cheats, and DraStic!  Thanks to MMC for their work with BS and DraStic!  I will add additional things, on request, for Next Update!  Personal thanks to nl255 for helping test DraStic!

**And, of course PSC Xtreme Core Injector Updated for AutoBleem! (Mini PSC!)**

Thanks to the collaboration of Genderbent, The Xtreme Core Injector is a much better thing this time around, complete with a greatly spruced up RetroArch 1.8.1!  Genderbent did some solid work, and it definitely shows in my testing!  I have a Tutorial on installing the Injector below!  Also, Genderbent's RetroBoot, which goes directly to RetroArch, for those who don't want the Main UI experience, is hard linked, above!

**Pseudo OpenBOR! (Mini PSC!)**

Main Release/PSC/OpenBOR, PSP, thanks to whitedragon0000, and all whom have ever worked on OpenBOR, we now have fairly excellent pseudo OpenBOR game playability!  At least, until we code in a launcher for the real deal, hopefully by next Release!  Thanks to TritonusRaven for continued test results on many Cores I post!

**ScummVM!!! Blade Runner FTW (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Blade Runner for PC now works with ScummVM!  I included the launchers in Xtras/ScummVM!  Thanks RobLoach for doing such a tremendous job updating the launchers!  You completely rock!  And, thanks to the 147+ developers, across thousands of coding changes, that helped make 2.1.0 ScummVM possible!

**The newly supported games are:**

- Blade Runner
- Duckman: The Graphic Adventures of a Private Dick
- Hoyle Bridge
- Hoyle Children's Collection
- Hoyle Classic Games
- Hoyle Solitaire
- Hyperspace Delivery Boy!
- Might and Magic IV - Clouds of Xeen

Mandalorian, what can I say:)  Shaping up to be a fun and great venture into the Star Wars Universe.  And, coincidentally, despite the episodes being set to air each Friday, they changed the airing of 2 specific episodes preceding and following the Skywalker movie, which comes out next month!  This would lend credence to the idea that something happens in Mandalorian that will be part of the Canon story line in Skywalker, and something that happens in Skywalker will be Canon to the Mandalorian story line!  My interest is peaked!

Well then, the Next Update drops on 11-26-19!  This is a big one, as Genderbent is back for yet another fantastic RetroBoot Release as well!  Many new Toys to play with, come this Tues!  The blood, sweat, and tears of Myself, Genderbent, and many other developers will be all yours to enjoy, then:)  So, be sure to check back!

- Other Notes!

  
*First Big News of the Day:)!**

**Hakchi2 CE Now Updated to have Preliminary RetroArch, Install/Uninstall Kernel for the Genesis Mini!!!**

**Refresh the Team Shinkansen Hakchi2 CE Link at top of this page, til which time Hakchi2 CE 3.6.0 goes Live!**

DanTheMan827 and madmonkey have practically been working around the clock to get Hakchi2 CE to a state where reasonable usage of Hakchi2 CE was viable!  And, they sure as hell did an absolutely incredible job!  

We now have the ability to install drivers, install/repair kernel, uninstall kernel, run RetroArch Xtreme, install Cores/HMODs, and more:)  Unfortunately, manipulation of the Main UI is not currently supported, at the time of this Release.  But, it may make the cut in a near future Hakchi2 CE Update!

My Video Demonstration of the process is at bottom of the Release Notes!  I go over several things, as far as installing the kernel, getting Cores/HMODs installed, FTPing in some games, and even disabling, activating Xtreme Overclock, and so on!  I will continue to do more videos on MD Mini.  Patton Plays will do his own share to help you guys and gals along, too!

**Xtreme OverClock Overview!**

**Now then, thanks to ALL of you who have tested Xtreme Overclock out and given us a ton of feedback and test results!  Common consensus of several hundred plus of you who have reached out to me is that a majority were able to run it quite nicely.  But, several had crashes/reboots, which are attributed to one of two causes.**  

- 1.  Your system is NOT compatible with Xtreme OC, due to quality assurance chip pass test at the factory!

This essentially means that they were mainly concerned with the S-NESC being able to work at 1.2 Ghz.  Anything higher they did not test for!  So, those who are on the lesser quality, non passing chips, will generally encounter harmless reboots/crashes.  You can disable Xtreme Overclock and/or uninstall it.  

- 2. Your hardware configuration or overall set-up is inadequate to support the additional Voltage/Mhz Processing Power.  IE: Trying to power with an adapter that is less than 5V/2A+ may cause issues if you try to run Xtreme Overclock.  NAND will work fine, more so than USB-HOST Xtreme Overclock, due to the nuances and differentials in added, needed power in USB-HOST.  So, I would strongly suggest first testing Xtreme Overclock on a strict NAND set-up.  Try a few MAME 2003 Xtreme Games, a few SNES Games, then try Volgarr the Viking from KMFD Mod Hub.  If you run all of these fine with Xtreme Overclock in place, especially Volgarr the Viking, you can test USB-HOST.  If your system proves to supply adequate power, then you have a good chance of pulling off Xtreme Overclock on USB-HOST, as well!

Personal thanks to each and every one of you who took the plunge with Xtreme Overclock!  It is an absolutely incredible addition.  And, I am very much loving its usage on MD-S-NESC!  Again, it will NOT work for everyone!  But, those of you who it does work for, enjoy it!  

I can potentially decrease overall Voltage and/or MHz Processing Speed to lower perimeters to try to find a median point where compatibility is more universal amongst those of you with "bad" chips for this cause!

Thanks nava, CaptSNES, hecthorpe, durpdurp420, AntiFly, and all else who have "tested" and given me exceptional feedback!  Nava, alone, tested for approximately 48 hours non-stop, nearly every waking moment, to help with test results!  We were able to confirm, with absolute certainty, that chips are not all guaranteed to be passable after 1.2 Ghz!  Nava switched to another system, after his main one kept crashing rebooting.  The "bad" system, was just that.  Bad chip, hence, no true ability for Xtreme OC to work properly!  But, his back-up system, worked flawlessly, and without a single issue!  Myself, my systems mostly and luckily worked out fine!  I tested them all.  The only one that failed was a 2016 NESC, which crashed on Dreamcast Games...So, THAT system is not compatible with Xtreme OC!  

Again, I will continue to communicate with any of you who continue to test as we update Xtreme OC, and try to account for more overall compatibility amongst lesser performing chips!

**Authentic Floppy Disk Loading Sound Effects with P-UAE Xtreme! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Those of you who have ever actually had a Floppy Disk for ANY computer will absolutely love this!  Simply install RetroArch Xtreme and/or Injector, depending on system, and load ANY Amiga game with P-UAE Xtreme, to enjoy some pure awesomeness, as far as authentic floppy disk loading sound effects!  Huge thanks to the incredible Amiga Efforts put forth by both rsn8887 and sonninnos.  Many other Amiga adjustments, as well, including Auto Centering and Automatic Zoom, amongst other such amazing things!

**Command Line City! (Mini S-NESC)**

ALL available Command Line Arguments are directly within the view of Hakchi, while displaying Cores, now:)  Thanks CaptSNES and AntiFly for testing and suggesting me get things adjusted to make things more optimal.  Additionally, I have brought back SNES9x 2016, since AntiFly and multiple others have informed me it really benefits quite a few SNES games!  Enjoy:)

**BIOS, who NEEDS BIOS, especially Dreamcast BIOS!:) (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Flycast not only gets a 5 Percent Performance+Speed Improvement, if you use the optimal RetroArch Xtreme and/or Injector Set-Up.  But, NOW, you do NOT NEED BIOS for Flycast Xtreme, whatsoever...other than for Naomi/Atomiswave Games!  You can STILL have BIOS installed, and they will be used for Reicast Xtreme, and of course Flycast Xtreme.  But, without BIOS, Flycast Xtreme will STILL run the games, despite them being missing:)
AWESOME!  Thanks Autechre and Flyinghead for working this incredible addition in!

**Other Notes!**

There are many many many other changes and additions, as well!  I will do videos on these!  Enjoy the Release!  Feel free to comment and suggest anything you'd like me to look into!  Before I leave you, I will leave a few links to my latest YouTube Videos for you to enjoy!

P.S. Don't forget to refresh the Hakchi2 CE Team Shinkansen Page!

P.S.S. Due to time constraints, BleemSync Accessibility for my Release will go out within a few days!

**10-17-19**

The update was an incredible success, and hundreds of people have already given me fantastic feedback on many things in said Update.  Overclock will be touched up and reposted in the Next Update.  I will also do a Video and Written Tutorial on the general etiquette to follow when handling Xtreme Overclock.  It is NOT for everyone.  But, those who do embrace it will find the bonuses and perks are quite extensive, especially regarding how much better SNES, MAME/FBA, etc games run!  And, anyone who does try out Overclock, don't hesitate to let me know if you need hands on assistance with any of its nuances.  Due to the differentials between some of the Minis and their general hardware set-up, Overclock will NOT work for everyone the same way.  One person might get a reboot due to not using a proper power supply.  Another, from not using a reputable, and too slow flash drive.  But, like with the varied USB-HOST, I will do my best to help you all account for your specialized and individual set-ups!

The warnings will be a bit more prominent in the follow-up Overclock.  I will do a bullet point list of exactly which potential behavior one might expect, depending on how they are set-up.  This will better lend credence to being more optimal for each of you.  RetroArch Xtreme will also be merged as one single entity, with OC Support, complete with control for Auto/Manual!  

Anyone in Our Discord is welcome to ping me or PM me, if they want to help test Overclock changes!

Expect the follow-up Release within a few days!  

P.S.  Since several of you requested it, I will Update my set to work with BleemSync, as well!

**10-15-19**

**The !@#$ Is About To Get Real!!!:)**

As Q-Bert would say:)  In any case, hope you all had a great last month!  It is time again for yet another fantastic and fun Release, with several new toys to play with!

Catching up, I just finished up the HULU Stephen King Mini-Series, with James Franco, 11-22-63.  If you are into Stephen King and Time Travel Scenarios, this show is perfect for you!  It involves Time Travel in an attempt to prevent JFK's Assassination.  Very interesting show, and easily one of the better King adapted Movies/Mini-Series!

El Camino was a fun continuation of the Breaking Bad Legacy, with some great turns by actors within the previous show!  Hope to see more from Aaron Paul, as Jesse, as well as other characters, in the future!  And, let's hope they can get Bryan Cranston to come back to the series, some way, some how!

Bslenul also informed me that there was a Creepshow series!  I am a big fan of the original two movies from the 1980s!  So, this was definitely very cool news to find out.  This, along with Are You Afraid of the Dark 3 episode Reboot Miniseries...fun times for October Halloween time:)  

And, now, just before posting the Update, I was able to get some Creepshow episodes in!  It is on the Shudder Streaming service, and I found it a fun Horror Anthology series, much like "Tales from the Crypt".  I believe, due to licensing issues with the tenative Tales from the Crypt reboot, they opted to go for the Creepshow license.  Each episode feels like the classic 1990s Crypt show!  And, just reading the generic synopsis for each episode, some didn't seem like they would be entertaining...such as, "A man finds a man in his suitcase..."  Suffice to say, I found that particular episode interesting, hehe.  

**Now then, here we go!:)**

**Sega Genesis Mini Successfully Modded! (Mini MD)**

Here is the kicker...Much of what was needed to pull it off was already in place, due to previous S-NESC Hacking!  In fact, my test demonstration of Modified MD Mini was showcased on the basis of madmonkey and company not even yet having a MD Mini!  Madmonkey and DanTheMan827 are currently hard at work, deeply involved in finishing up Hakchi2 CE Support for the MD Mini.  It will be an absolutely fantastic and phenomenal Release, once they post it in the very near future!

I have also worked in support for nearly ALL Cores/HMODs from my S-NESC Set to work with the MD Mini!  In addition to that, once DanTheMan827 and madmonkey Update, you will be able to set ALL Cores from this Release via a right click, Emulation Core Selection:)  My current Release works with the MD Mini (shown in my videos with WIP), as far as once Team Shinkansen Releases the next Hakchi2 CE:)  I have been testing and working it in over the last few weeks!

**!@# Is About To Get Real!!!:)  We Now Have Xtreme OverClock!!!:) (Mini MD-S-NESC)**

**Note: Due to differentials in "some" Mini Classics, Xtreme Overclock is not guaranteed to work in all Units.  The best way to test that it is working is to run Mega Man X2 with SNES9x 2005, and do the Bubble Crab stage.  At the point where the "big fish" comes into the screen, the game normally slows down to a crawl...even on the real hardware!  If it runs at a brisker pace, OC is working just fine!  My other personal test is NARC with MAME 2003 Xtreme, which will be quite stuttery at normal Clock Speed.  With OC in effect, it runs near seamlessly, with just minor sound hiccups.  We will adjust things accordingly, in future Releases, to best benefit the End User as far as most optimal Speed+Performance+Safe Temps!**

Default specifications for Mhz Processing + Allowable OC, on each of the Minis...are as follow:

•MD Default = 1.008 Ghz|Overclocked = 1.34 Ghz
•S-NESC Default = 1.2 Ghz|Overclocked = 1.34 Ghz
•PSC Default = 1.5 Ghz|Overclocked = To Be Determined

With THIS Release, you will have two options for Xtreme Overclock.  Automatic and Manual.  Manual ONLY currently works with S-NESC.  Automatic will work fine with MD-S-NESC!  PSC is still WIP, as far as any potential gain it can get from OC!  To enable OverClock Manually, install Xtreme OverClock and RetroArch 1.7.9 Xtreme W/Manual OC.  Then, go to the Command Line for any game you'd like to apply OC to, and add a space, then...
--overclock  ONLY games run with this perimeter will OC.  Synch/Export, enjoy!  IE:

**/bin/flycast /var/games/CLV-I-OAEKD/Ikaruga.cdi --overclock**

For Automatic Xtreme Overclocking, install Xtreme Overclock and RetroArch 1.7.9 Xtreme W/Auto OC.  Then, all Games/Cores/System, will run at 1.34 Ghz.

I very highly recommend you have at least a 5V/2A+ Power Adapter Source if using Xtreme Overclock and/or OTG!  

Last, but not least, this very important Disclaimer, regarding Xtreme Overclock!

**Warning:  Any use of OverClock is entirely at your discretion.  Understand, there are always minimal risks involved when going against the grain framework that a system is set-up with.  We take no liability if you damage or screw up your system via OverClock!  But, that being said, hundreds of hours of testing, we maintained safe temperatures, as well as exceptional stability with RetroArch Xtreme!  SO then, ONLY use OverClock if you understand the potential risks involved!**

If you DO decide to utilize Overclocking, enjoy its sheer and pure and unadulterated awesomeness:)

Huge thanks to the wonderful collaboration of bslenul and madmonkey for helping make the Overclocking more stable and optimal for usage on the Mini Classics! Overclocking will likely change in future Updates, for the better, as well!  So, stay tuned! 

**What better way to apply Xtreme OverClock, than with Updated Dreamcast Cores! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Both Reicast Xtreme and Flycast Xtreme benefit from Xtreme Overclocking.  You will be running Dreamcast Games better than ever before.  Check out some of my demonstrations in the below videos!  But, finally, enjoy Marvel Vs Capcom 2, in a much more playable fashion, especially geared towards 2 Player Mode Activate!  Thank you all who have EVER worked on any Dreamcast Emulator/Core!  DC is up there, for me, along with PCE, NES, MAME!  And, thanks Autechre, flyinghead, skmp, for all your truly phenomenal efforts!

**RetroArch Xtreme Updated:) (Mini MD-S-NESC)**

This is ONLY for MD-S-NESC, for now.  Expect an updated RetroArch Xtreme for PSC sometime in October, once Genderbent and myself get some more solid and thorough testing in.  RetroBoot will be back, better than ever, very soon:)  For now, enjoy a vastly improved RetroArch Xtreme for MD-S-NESC, with a lot of great clean-ups, fixes, adjustments, additions, such as:

**Add PS1, DC, and other Disk Based Games to Playlists (Mini MD-S-NESC)**

Due to hashing issues, Disk Based Games were not as easily added to RetroArch Playlists.  They add quite nicely now.  So, enjoy!  In conjunction with Thumbnails, even better!  I have Thumbnails on the Google Drive Link, in Xtras/Thumbnails.  These can be copied to USB, to the hakchi/retroarch/thumbnails directory to be used along with RetroArch Xtreme!  They take up far too much space to be optimal for NAND Usage, whatsoever, unfortunately.  Thanks bslenul, for helping optimize USB Usage of some of the NAND draining stuff!  Genderbent and myself will get Playlists fixed up for PSC within the next few weeks, as well!

**DOSBox SVN Plug & Play Optimizations! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Personal thanks to the suggestions of Patton, gamecleaner, and anyone else who had expressed interest in me fixing up DOS to be more User Friendly.  Plus, of course, thank you fr500 and R-Type, for helping with my initial idea of implementing keyboard to controller mapping.  It is an asset that makes all PC Cores much much better!

In any case, I have worked in Plug & Play Controller Support for several games, including DOS Mega Man 1, 3 Number Munchers, Stargunner, Tyrian!  I recommend using at least an SNES/PSC controller, for best results.  Most DOS games utilize too many buttons to be viable on an NESC controller, unfortunately!

If any of you want other DOS games worked in, feel free to let me know, and I will do what I can!

**DOSBox SVN Mega Man 1+3 Patches for Speed Normalization! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

You can handle "too fast" games one of two different ways.  One, RetroArch Settings, Input, Hot Key Binds, Map Slow Motion Toggle to an unused button, and that helps with Mega Man 1, 3, Round 42!  But, for Mega Man 1+3, there is also a fantastic normalization of speed patch, along with some other nifty perks, that Bbbradsmith put together.  I have included it in Xtras/PERM-CHEATS-PATCHING/DOS.  Just copy the extracted patch into the same directly as the mm.exe, run the patch with the Core.  It will then apply said patch, and give you a new mm.exe.  Simply delete the original mm.exe and rename the new MM1.exe or MM3.exe to mm.exe, and run THAT .exe to properly play the game with the Update!

**Speaking of Mega Man...How about a Mega Man Street Fighter Cross-Over for your PC!  (PC Only)**

In Xtras/Games/PC, is an amazing PC only Mega Man Street Fighter Cross-Over Game that will work perfectly with a PSC controller, as well as general USB controllers!  The story behind this is quite interesting.  Typically, when someone does a fan made game, and a company gets wind of it, the company promptly issues a cease and desist...such as in the case of Nintendo with Metroid AM2R.  But, not every company is like that.  Some, like Capcom and Sega, embrace the fan mades, and that is why Streets of Rage fan mades are prevalent and not stopped.  And, of course, in this very special case of Mega Man...

Seow Zong Hui started working on an amazing venture, a Mega Man Street Fighter Cross-Over, wherein each stage was designed around a specific Street Fighter character.  He was able to show the game to a Capcom Representative, Christian Svenson, who brought it to others' attention within Capcom.  Capcom took interest and personally helped finish developing the game.  Due to a few legal constraints as far as platform Release, Capcom opted to make the game completely free and available to the public for PC!  It is a top notch Mega Man game that many are not aware of.  It fits right in with the earlier ones, 4-7!  So, check it out!  

You will need to initially use a keyboard to get into the settings to configure the controller to work!  But, once set up, it will work every time:)  Enjoy!  There are, of course, OTHER Mega Man games, too.  I will try to work more in, once I test them further for ease of use with PSC, etc controllers!

**Two NEW DOS games added to the KMFD Mod Hub!  (Mini S-NESC)**

Apogee's Stargunner, an amazing SHMUP...And, Round 42, a nifty Retro SHMUP from the Metroid NES Era, made by Elven Software Company!  Thanks Patton, for recommending Round 42.  Very fun stuff, indeed!  Enjoy!

**Who Loves Donkey Kong!?:) (Mini PSC)**

This is primarily for PSC, for now!  I will try to work the coding in for MD-S-NESC, for the NEXT Update!  Enjoy some incredible Donkey Kong Hacks, such as Spooky, Reverse, X-Mas, and so on, with the Updated AutoBleem Xtreme Core Injector, and FB NEO!  Load the hack as the trigger game, having dkong.zip as the dependency, within the SAME folder:)  Thanks to all who have worked on these amazing hacks, as well as barbudreadmon, for helping implement these.  And, dinkc64 for his exceptional work, too...Loving the UMK3 Plus Hack (umk3pb1.zip) which will also work with THIS Update:)  Copy umk3.zip into same folder as the hack, load the hack!  Again, MD-S-NESC Users.  I will work this in for you, NEXT Update:)  Thanks DRVR 99 for getting me into DK Hacks to begin with!

You can run them by having dkong.zip within a folder, as the dependency game, of which you'd load one of the following rom hacks, to draw from dkong.zip!  Thanks barbudreadmon for your dedication to helping get these into FB NEO!

- dkongrev.zip   = Donkey Kong Reverse Hack (Thanks Paul Goes!)
- kong2600.zip  = Donkey Kong 2600 Graphics Hack
- dkspkyrmx.zip = Donkey Kong Spooky Remix Hack
- dkchrmx.zip    = Donkey Kong Christman Remix Hack

I showcase some of these in the below video.  I will show more in future videos!

**Who Loves F-Zero!?:) (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

**I also showcase in my F-Zero Video below, how to run Analog Controls for the game on a D-Pad!

F-Zero has been a mainstay for me for many many years now!  I included an amazing patch for the rom hack, F-Zero X Climax, which is a reimagining of the GBA Japan Only F-Zero Climax, with new textures, 3d Effects, etc...done by Philippe Brodier!  It is included within Xtras/PERM-CHEATS-PATCHING!  Use Lunar IPS to apply it:)

**How about Nintendo 64DD F-Zero!?:) (Mini PSC)**

I have been asked about 64DD countless times.  The F-Zero X Expansion Pack is pretty awesome, in fact.  There are several different ways to run it.  But, no matter the case, it generally requires 8MB Expansion Memory to pull off on the Mini Classics.  This handles best with PSC.  It CAN work on MD-S-NESC.  But, expect slower gameplay and/or crashes.  PSC is most definitely the ONLY recommended route for these!  The way I found works out best is the amazing Rom Dump Merge Porting by Zointkity of F-Zero X+64DD Expansion Pack, to work within the context of one singular N64 Rom, which will run great with the Updated Parallel in THIS Update.  One caveat, it runs without sound, sort of like the Daphne Core!  But, jam some Megadeth, Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, Pantera, and you will be golden!

**WPA Supplicant WI-FI HMOD Updated to support Spaces in SSID! (Mini S-NESC)**

Thanks for the fix DNA64!  Now, if your SSID has spaces in it, such as Tales From The Crypt, versus TalesFromTheCrypt, in prior Releases, it would not work.  Now, it does!!!  Thanks again, DNA64!

**First, PSC Controller on S-NESC...Now, MD Mini Controller on (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

Awhile back, we added support for the PSC Controller so that it would work with both the SNES and NES Classics.  Now, you can, for the sake of nostalgia...run the MD Mini Controller on all three, with the Updated RetroArch Xtreme and/or relevant Injectors!  Note, there IS no Select button.  So, you won't be able to access RetroArch select+start shortcut on S-NESC.  So, utilizing the MD Mini Controller, for now...it is best to run from Main UI or use RetroArch UI from Main UI on the S-NESC.  PSC, it isn't a matter, since you are directly running from RetroArch, anyways!  But, it is still sorely missed, that Select Button!  Suffice to say...MD/Genesis Games play quite nicely, and feel right at home on the full sized MD Controller!

**AMIGA Improved a great deal! (Mini MD-S-NESC-PSC)**

Thanks so much, sonninnos and rsn8887, for your continuing dedication to make the Commodore Amiga and 64 Systems better and better!  So many fixes, changes, adjustments!  Wait til you all try Agony with updated RetroArch Xtreme+P-UAE Xtreme+Xtreme Overclock, on the MD-S-NESC!  And, yeah, PSC Users, you will enjoy greater benefits, too!  This time around, some controller fixes for Player 1, wherein sometimes a direction would get stuck, and you'd have to push something else, then that direction again, to get unstuck.  I personally experienced this with Apidya.  It now works great!  The issue is still potentially possible with Player 2, since that is a Mouse Port.  But, I am testing fixes for it, which should go out Next Release!  In the vein of Butterfly Mod Effect, I am most certainly not going to jump the gun on the Player 2 Fix, without first testing things!  I have personally had very few instances of the bug, in any case!  I have had no issues running Chaos Engine with 2 Player Mode Activate!    

Mouse wise, if you "move" your mouse, it should now automatically switch over to mouse usage.  If you want to manually change it, go into RetroArch Settings, Quick Menu, Options, and you can remap RETROK_RCTRL to your RetroPad Select.  

Personal thanks to bslenul for helping test the dozens upon dozens upon dozens of changes!  If anyone truly wants the "Legacy" P-UAE, I can repost.  But, performance, speed, overall optimizations are sooo much better with the current P-UAE Xtreme.  In the event anyone does prefer the older version, feel free to open an issue on this Github, and I will post it for you, as well as get Legacy Support for the Next Release!  

**General Clean-Up!**

Some of the HMODs, such as Custom Borders/Wallpapers/Mess Dependencies, etc, which took quite a bit of NAND space, I moved additional "Custom" Files from, to Xtras/Borders, Wallpapers, etc.  Simply copy and paste anything you DO want to install, back into said HMODs.  Any Bleemsync related stuff I post will be strictly on the Google Drive link, for the immediate future...as I needed to get the "7z Assets" down in size as much as possible. 
It is knocked down roughly 500 MB, this time around,comparatively to the last several Releases!  In the meantime, if anyone needs help running my Release on BleemSync, just let me know, and I will do my best to personally assist!

**9-9-19**

**Anytime a "NEW" RetroArch comes out, I like to put it through its paces before updating to the latest version.  If testing checks out, and things prove stable and reliable enough, expect 1.7.8 for my current set-up, probably within the Next Release or so:)  I generally like to get several hours of testing in before posting a NEW RetroArch, so as to avoid any potential conflicts and/or issues.  Not only that, EVERY Core needs retested with an Updated RetroArch, as the "Butterfly Mod Effect" can easily be causal fate to a breakage in some way, shape, or form!  Again, this will not always affect "every" platform equally!  Luckily, this time, many of the coding changes are more so for PC End Users.  So, there is not a whole lot lost in the transition.  PSC Users can try out 1.7.8 with the latest BleemSync, of course.  But, so far, my tests are showing more comfortable grips with the reality of 1.7.7, for the time being!**  

**You can check out my YouTube channel for videos relating to much of what is posting within this Update:)**

**Bloggity Blog Blog Blog:)**

Hello again, everyone!  It is almost hard to believe I actually have Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night still sealed and backlogged!  I really need to play it once I post this Update!  MetroidVania FTW!  One can never have enough MetroidVania games!  Additionally, I still have Metroid 2: Samus Returns for 3DS sealed, and that demands a play!  So, once the Update goes up, both of those games will be on my to do list as far as playthroughs:)  

I caught up on a few TV Shows and Movies.  I am a huge horror fan, so of course checked out Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.  If you ever liked Are You Afraid of the Dark, you will be right at home.  Speaking of which, they are gonna revive the show in a limited series later this year, come October (Halloween Time).  Horror anthology shows have always been a mainstay for me, as far back as the great 1950s Alfred Hitchcock Presents, which by the way, came out before Twilight Zone.  The two shows were distinctively different, as Twilight Zone had a more fantastical approach, whereas Alfred Hitchcock was psychological.  

Another show that was on par with Alfred Hitchcock was the 1980s Canadian HBO show, The Hitchhiker, which has one of the most memorable themes, ever:)  I also got into Tales from the Crypt, Monsters, Tales from the Darkside, and so on!  Of more recent times, Black Mirror is pretty well known, fun, good.  But, I also really thought Inside No. 9 was pretty cool, and am looking forward to the next season for that.  

**Well then, enough blogging...Let us get to the Update!!!**

As per normal, the main Release is way way way at the bottom, 9-9-19 .7z assets download.  You can alternately grab anything from both alternative links.  And, for you SNES/NES Classic Users, via Hakchi2 CE, Modules, KMFD Mod Hub.  I intend to do some consolidation and optimization as far as how big the overall download is, probably within the next few Releases.  Some stuff will be removed and exclusively on the Google Drive Link.  But, since this is quite an overhaul of an Update, I am going to try to maintain its integrity, at least, for this Release!  But, I will try to knock at least 500+ MB off of the Next Release!

And, especially, with the incoming Genesis Mini, I will most certainly need to make room to account for that system, as well!  I am hopeful that it has the best perks of NES/SNES/PSC, in addition to a little extra performance and speed overhead!  But, we shall see very soon!

**This Time Around! 9-9-19!**

Every time I get an Update together and posted, I wonder what I can possibly put out next.  Luckily, there is always more fun stuff to get out there!  What is the special significance of this date in history, specifically?  Well, 9-9-99 marked the US Release date of both the Sega Dreamcast, as well as PS1's Final Fantasy VIII!  What made things particularly rough with the Dreamcast was the fact that they released some of the games before the system!  I had Hydro Thunder, Soul Calibur, Sonic Adventure, Trickstyle, and House of the Dead 2 sitting there, waiting to be played, for an entire week prior!  Many sites, online, will state Release Dates of the launch titles as 9-9-19.  But, in truth, they really and mostly came out a week earlier!  I also distinctly remember Blue Stinger being a game that caused many a system to overheat with its first Release.  It seemed to almost be a CTRL+ALT+DEL sort of scenario, heh:)  Before they patched and rereleased a fixed version, the best way to run it without freezing up your Dreamcast was to flip the system upside down!  The air vent was on the bottom, and things actually operated more optimally, when upside down!  

As a few added bonuses to make this Commemorative 20 year anniversary of the Dreamcast more interesting, I have included the Dreamcast Homebrew game, Volgarr the Viking, a great Rastan/Legendary Axe styled side scrolling hack and slash game, with a nice heaping helping of blood and violence and gore.  It is made by Crazy Viking Studios.  I thank them for giving permission to share the amazing game!  Mini NES/SNES Users can grab the game from Hakchi2 CE, Modules, KMFD Mod Hub, Games Tab.  PSC Users can nab it from Google Drive Link, Xtras/Games.  In addition to this game, which will...of course, run better on PSC!...I have also included a "Comic Reader application" from when I was working on the Nintendo Power Scanning Project 14+ years back.  At the Google Drive Link, for a temporary time, in Xtras/MXYZPTLK folder, you will find the first Sega Dreamcast Magazine!  It is a very fun read.  For future reference, you might want to check the MXYZPTLK folder, as I may continue to add more surprises to it.  Also, included this time around, in that folder, is a Top_Rated_Games_-_all_Consoles that JW Pepper was nice enough to compile from various sources, for those of you looking for the "next" retro game to play!

Lastly, related to Dreamcast, some of you might remember me as SadnessOfDEL and/or KMFDManic from Phantasy Star Online V1/V2.  PSO was one of the very first mainstream MMORPG styled games of the time.  Shame Dreamcast was way ahead of its time as far as this was concerned...as it still didn't help the system succeed overall!  But, with games like Volgarr the Viking, Sturmwind, Gunlord, and so on...the system is still fresh, each and every new day...20 years later!    

 So, here come the bullet points, Release Notes, YouTube Video links, Final Closing Notes!:)

- ScummVM now has pseudo MT-32 sound support! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)
- ScummVM "Crashing On Exit" Fixed!  (Mini S-NESC-PSC)
- MAME 2003 Xtreme becomes more Xtreme (Mini S-NESC-PSC)
- Speaking of Artwork, beautiful MAME Art added to Google Drive Link! (Mini S-NESC)
- Amiga and Commodore 64 have gotten a Hell of a Lot Better! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)
- Mod Hub greatly spruced up with some nifty artwork! (Mini S-NESC)
- Sharp X1 Core Added! Let's play us some Super Mario Bros. Special! (Mini S-NESC)
- Other Notes!
- The Videos!

**ScummVM now has pseudo MT-32 sound support! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

**The following warning is merely a frame of reference...it is no longer applicable!  Once you Update, the Injector for PSC and/or ScummVM Core for NESC/SNESC, the crashing is absolutely fixed with a nice and graceful exit, thanks to hhromic!**

**This warning existed for the previous Release and was shown in my latest videos!  It no longer applies:)  Important: Do NOT exit RetroArch or attempt to load another game from ScummVM Core...Push Start, which opens up the ScummVM Menu, then QUIT that way, and ONLY that way.  Or, you will freeze RetroArch and/or your system!  Additionally, if you don't exit properly, you may encounter corruption, and/or need to reinstall AutoBleem/BleemSync, if on PS Classic!  So, tread very carefully, and exit properly!  Also, on PS Classic, do not attempt to Exit to Launcher, or you will suffer the same fate.  Again, Start Button, ScummVM Menu, Quit:)**

It was pretty darn amazing when we got ScummVM going last year.  I had great collaboration with madmonkey and beylie on the original project.  I also greatly appreciate the efforts of the original authors, as well as anyone within Libretro who had ever worked on that port, coding wise!  One thing that was asked of me, once I posted it...pretty soon after, was whether or not MT-32 worked.  Unfortunately, it did not, at the time.  

For those of you not in the know...ScummVM stands for Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion Virtual Machine, and is a set of game engine recreations. Originally designed to play LucasArts adventure games that use the SCUMM system, it also supports a variety of non-SCUMM games by companies like Revolution Software and Adventure Soft. It was originally written by Ludvig Strigeus.[2] Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, ScummVM is free software.

ScummVM is a reimplementation of the part of the software used to interpret the scripting languages such games used to describe the game world rather than emulating the hardware the games ran on; as such, ScummVM allows the games it supports to be played on platforms other than those for which they were originally released.

MT-32 is a sound implementation with some truly robust sound, such as from a Roland Synthesizer.  Even something, such as percussion, is quite drastically different in the scheme of MT-32.  We were unable to get true MT-32 going, due to the lack thereof MUNT, which was a dependency needed to pull it off, initially.  I have since gotten MT-32 working...But, it is quite CPU intensive, and has audio stuttering on our lower spec hardwares!  But, alas, nava and myself devised a very clever workaround, wherein we utilized MIDI to swap out sound samples for pseudo MT-32, and even NES Chiptune styled affairs.  It truly needs to be heard to be believe.  The absolute oomph factor is near astronomical once you get into checking many many of the games that benefit from either/or!

There are 3 Injectors subsets, for Default/MT-32/NES, for AutoBleem/BleemSync, for the PS Classic, within PS CLASSIC Folder.  Whichever one you install "last" will be the one that takes precedence over any former installed one.

For NES/SNES Classic, you will have Default/MT-32/NES HMODs, which can be gotten from Primary Release, alternative links, or KMFD Mod Hub, within Add-Ons.  Same as PS Classic, whichever is installed last, takes priority.

So, enjoy the pure awesomeness!  Check out the videos below the Release Notes to see some of these amazing sound samplings in action!  Thanks nava for your dedication to this project!  It turned out great:)  

Special bonus, go to Google Drive Link, Xtras, Game Art, for a new nice nifty set of ScummVM Box Art, courtesy of Klopjero!  Also, on Mod Hub for NES/SNES, you can grab two great ScummVM games...Beneath a Steel Sky and Flight of the Amazon Queen!  These are on Google Drive, Xtras, Games, for PSC Users!  Enjoy:)

**ScummVM "Crashing On Exit" Fixed!  (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

As in my video demonstrations, this was an incredibly irritating issue.  Anytime you'd attempt to Exit via RetroArch and/or Load Core/Load Content, NOT from ScummVM Start Menu, RetroArch would freeze/crash.  This was especially bad, more so for Playstation Classic, since an improper shutdown nearly always leads to disk corruption...And, you'd generally need to do a disk check, as well as reinstall AutoBleem/BleemSync/RetroBoot.  

No more!  All is good now.  Personal thanks to the aforementioned hhromic!

**MAME 2003 Xtreme becomes more Xtreme (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

MAME 2003 Standard is completely removed, as it is no longer necessary for our platforms.  Instead, you will have choice of MAME 2003 Xtreme/Plus, which will cover everything you possibly need!  Xtreme goes the route of slightly better edged out performance and speed, with Plus going for overall better compatibility.  But, nearly anything you can do in one can be coded into the other, within reason!  Just not sound for Out Foxies, unfortunately!  Plus/Xtreme both take the Experimental Route, trying to keep the best of both worlds...Legacy Game Support, with a sprinkling of NEWER MAME Coding.  This helps tremendously with Performance, especially with games like Ninja Baseball Batman, Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder, Night Slashers, and hundreds others, which run absolutely awful on newer MAMEs for the Mini Platforms!

/bin/mame2003-xtreme and/or /bin/mame2003-plus  PSC Users can simply load the Cores!

Several new additions for MAME 2003 Xtreme, this Release!  You can now run ALL Metal Slug games, 1-5, X, all with Xtreme, as well as Plus!  Personal thanks to arcadez2003 and grant2258, two great Plus Team mates that went out of their way to help ensure our Mini Experience gets better and better each Release!

Aside from Metal Slug Series, the entire NEO-GEO video driver has had improvements for better performance, speed, and overall integrity...So, all around, NEO-GEO is hella better for both Plus/Xtreme!

As seen in my SHMUP 'Stravaganza Video below, I discovered a bug within Macross 2, while getting more games together for said video.  Arcadez2003 was great in helping get it fixed up and patched for Plus/Xtreme.  Some amazing new additions, MAME 2003 Xtreme wise, include:

- Hang On Graphics Fixed!
- Metal Slug 1-5, X all supported!
- SNES Controller Mapping Matched For SF2 Arcade and other Capcom Games!  
- Ring King/Mat Mania Sprite Glitches Fixed!
- Crazy Balloon Sound Fixed!
- Macross 2 Sound Fixed!
- Hyper Duel SHMUP Support Added!
- Power Instinct Legends Support Added + Background Dancing Fixed!
- Super Space Invaders 1999 Butterfly Power Up Fixed!
- Thunderzone Graphic Glitches Fixed!
- Dynamite Duke Bad Colors Fixed!

The beautiful thing about SF2, is playing the SNES Version, then the Arcade Version...And, the controls are now identical!  I thank grant2258 for this suggested fix up!  It is purely awesome and quite welcome!

I am ecstatic about Macross 2, as it is a spectacularly cool SHMUP.  The sound fixes really really make it a hell of a lot better.  I showcase it in one of the MAME 2003 Xtreme Update Videos below!  

Otherwise, EVERY addition (except for Dynamite Duke and Ring King and SF2) above gets a showcase in the MAME 2003 Xtreme Videos:)

I will continue to collaborate with the great guys from the Plus Team, and try to keep things as awesome as possible on the Xtreme end of things!  Thanks again, grant2258 and arcadez2003!  Oh, one more thing:)

**And, the big one:)**

- Midway/Bally/Atari Vector Games are hard coded to refresh sample rate to work correctly!

What this means, is that games such as Tapper, Rampage, Journey, Star Wars Arcade, which I had done temporary duct tape fixes on, in the past...will permanently work, now (even on other Platforms/RetroArchs!  The complete list of fixed up games include:

**Speaking of Artwork, beautiful MAME Art added to Google Drive Link! (Mini S-NESC)**

On Google Drive Link, Xtras, Game Art, is a new set of amazing Arcade Art Work, for your perusal.  Thank you, Robin55!

**Amiga and Commodore 64 have gotten a Hell of a Lot Better! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

Amiga has been a thorn in our sides for quite some time.  Qclart, Madmonkey, and myself have done what we could Mini wise, particularly with our lower spec hardwares.  And, I give thanks to anyone who has ever worked with or on P-UAE, period!  I give personal and huge thanks to both rsn8887 and sonninnos, both of whom have vested a very personal interest in not only Amiga, but also Commodore 64!  

For starters, P-UAE Xtreme will now play games such as Agony at a far better performance and speed, exponentially, than ever before!  Most other games will also benefit, as well, such as Shadow of the Beast on SNESC, and so on.  AGA games will net a boost, too:)  To run AGA games, that typically give an error about not enough memory, you can simply ensure that (AGA) is in their titles...such as Aladdin(AGA).hdf  SNES/NES Users, simply let hakchi compress the games, and you will retain the (AGA).  

Additionally, thanks to those who originally worked on it, as well as the great recommendation and testing of bslenul, I have implemented .ipf support for Amiga.  Just install latest RetroArch Xtreme or Injector, and .ipf files will work, as long as BIOS are appropriately set up!  Speaking of BIOS!...   

My Amiga DUMMIES Tutorial covers some of the changes for BIOS, related to Amiga, P-UAE Xtreme.  The new set-up is:

P-UAE Xtreme = kick34005.A500 (Amiga 500), kick40063.A600 (Amiga 600), kick40068.A1200 (Amiga 1200), WHDLoad.hdf.  The WHDLoad.hdf will not need injected with any of the kickstarts.  But, it may still be handy for those who want to add cheats, work in saves, etc.  Both AutoBleem/BleemSync Injectors will install WHDLoad.hdf for PSC.  For you Mini NESC/SNESC Users, it is in the Mod Hub, under KMFD BIOS.  Note the other BIOS I can also legally share!  It will help save you a lot of headaches!  

Now, then, once WHDLoad.hdf is accounted for, which will help run .hdf games...You mainly have to at least have kick40063.600, which will run a vast majority of games.  The other 2 are there in case you want to run older Amiga 500 or newer Amiga 1200 (AGA) (Advanced Graphics Architecture) ones, such as Aladdin.  Low and behold, with this Update...definitely check out Agony!!!  You will NOT need .uae files with this set-up.  You can see within my Video Tutorial what I mean, along with demonstrations.  As always, feel free to ask me any questions, if you need any assistance with Amiga, which is generally one of the more difficult Cores to get up and running!

**Mod Hub greatly spruced up with some nifty artwork! (Mini S-NESC)**

I have decided to spruce things up, Mod Hub wise, with some nifty artwork, and a complete overhaul to how things display.  Notice how Cores will now show which BIOS are needed, and so on.  For PSC Users, you can go to Xtras/BIOS, to get that information:)  I tried to clean things up, so things are far more optimal and easier to navigate.  I also put notations on the "Slow" Cores, so you realize they are for pure novelty and not serious play!

**Sharp X1 Core Added! Let's play us some Super Mario Bros. Special! (Mini S-NESC)**

We had the original Super Mario Bros., which was on Famicom/NES...But, after that, came a sequel called Super Mario Bros. 2...which we in the USA never got, until it came as part of Super Mario All Stars on SNES, and was retooled as Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels!  We, instead, got Super Mario Bros 2 AKA Doki Doki Panic...Not complaining, however, as it was such a fun game that holds up quite well all these years later.  Along with Blaster Master, Super Mario Bros. 2 was an incredibly difficult game for me to obtain at the time, especially before Xmas!  In any case, there was also Super Mario Bros. Special, which was released on Sharp X1, as well as PC-88.  Both are uniquely different enough to warrant playing, due to how odd the scrolling and overall playability is!  You can see me do a demonstration of these in my video below!  Thanks r-type, for working on this amazing Core!  Gradius is also a hoot to play, for how oddly different it feels to any other port!

**Other Notes!**

Huge thanks to bslenul, and of course JW Pepper for testing...NESC/SNESC wise...these RetroArch Xtreme changes!

 **Misc**

- clover-canoe-shvc: tweaked the filters arguments for Canoe and RA, so you can use bilinear in perfect pixel mode for example (only worked with 4:3 before) and added a --crt-mode which adds both scanlines and bilinear
- preinit file: check if read/write access to /media/hakchi for USB and SS for RA states
- fix for SNES not working on NES with Canoe in command line.

You can view other changes and previous additions, whilst viewing RetroArch Xtreme within hakchi:)

**Nearly Every Core Updated!**

Most of the Cores were Updated...Some were recompiled with a few flag changes to help with performance/speed.  As always, feedback matters!  Anytime someone brings something to my attention, we do our best to get things fixed up, on that account!  With the "Butterfly Mod Effect", it is inevitable that things may break from time to time.  But, they are usually fixed up, pretty fast, especially with End User Feedback!  You can see in my MAME 2003 Xtreme Video, some before/after fix ups! 

**WIP**

I had intended to do more with DOSBox.  But, due to time constraints, that will be WIP for the next Update.  Several people, including Patton, have asked me about DOSBox.  I will try to employ a set of standards to make overall usability and play easier for the average user.  It isn't a simple case of cut and dry, in many instances.  But, I will do a video, as well as make a new install to help with running some games for both DOSBox, as well as MSX (Metal Gear 1, 2)!  You can refer to my YouTube page, as well as my Github Release Page, and, of course, the Google Drive Link, to get some stuff prior to Release! 

I keep consistently getting asked about Nintendo Power gaps, and so on.  To reiterate, there are not "that many" issues missing from the earlier Torrents that were posted.  But, there are some.  It will take a few hours to audit and get my current set up to speed, of which I haven't had time to do with work/updates/personal life, etc.  But, it is still on my loose agenda to try to get done sometime in the near or decent future!  I may randomly toss some Nintendo Power related stuff onto the Google Drive Link, Xtras/MXYZPTLK  Just check back occasionally, and you might find a pleasant surprise!  

There are "other" things Updated within the Release that I didn't have the space or time to do Release Notes on.  Like an Open World Mod Adventure, some of these you will discover on your own, and/or see in my upcoming videos!  But, definitely check out the Killer Instinct N64 Tutorial to run with more optimal speed/performance!  For the record, I made some changes since some of the these videos, to account for issues I relate to in the videos!.  For example, AutoBleem Xtreme Core Injector has some touch ups so that overall performance and speed for ALL Cores is better!  You will see when you try to run Dreamcast, N64, etc:)  Killer Instinct runs even better than in my video demonstration with the finalized set-up! 

DOSBox is Next:)  But, due to its very complicated nature, I may need to set up some .uae style configuration files...In this case. .con files, to help account for the multitude of different game set-ups!  I will try to get some done for the more popular games, first!  Some of the "glitches" you may encounter, are not actually glitches...such as characters moving by themselves, etc.  These are merely conflicts due to how the controller/keyboard work.  I will, again, work things out to try to help you all along with playing many of these truly fascinating games...including Star Trek TNG:) 

ScummVM will get some more Updating, too:)  Nava has been more than happy to collaborate and test anything and everything relative to the amazing Core!  So, expect more, Next Time:)

I will be sure to get these 2 in some videos, along with other similarly minded games!

See you Next Time, as well as in the interim on the usual platforms:)

Sincerely, KMFDManic AKA Kyland K:)

**7-23-19**

**Google Drive may take a little longer to Update.  But, wanted to get this Release out before I had to leave for work!**

**Release obtainable from way down below Release Notes, 7z assets for 7-23-19, or via the alternate links!**

**Some of the more technical aspects to this Release will turn up within the context of Video Tutorials throughout this and next week!**

**Prelude**

*And here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time
But here I go again
Here I go again
Here I go again
Ooh baby, ooh yeah*

Whitesnake's Here I Go Again has always been one of my favorite retro songs!  It was also hella fun to play in Rock Band 3 with Microphone, Drums, Guitar and Bass!  Rock Band/Guitar Hero are pretty much DOA at this point.  Shame we never got Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd!  But, I still have fun playing around with them, as well as Rock Band Blitz...the offshoot game, occasionally!

In any case, welcome to the very next Update!  Many fun and new surprises in store, this time around!  I, more or less, focused on reality over the last month to get things in check.  Never take for granted what matters most in life!  And, it certainly is not video games:)  Your family and loved ones should always be top priority, first and foremost!  And, of course, your own sense of well being and preservation, as well!  

Final tidbit before moving onto the Release Notes and such!  For those of you who loved Breakin' Bad, and were looking for a fun diversion in a uniquely different context, check out Amazon Prime's Sneaky Pete!  It has a great turn by Bryan Cranston, to boot...to start things off with a nice bang!  I binge watched right into Season 2, pretty fast and furious:)  There have not been a whole lot of shows that have gotten me to want to watch episode after episode after episode.  But, the quality shows that do come along and stand out for me have been ones like Breakin' Bad, Game of Thrones, Shield, Dexter, Prison Break, LEXX, Heroes, Lost, Banshee, and so on!  

And, like word association, if Breakin' Bad is to Sneaky Pete, then Game of Thrones is to Harlots.  Harlots is a fun show on Hulu, which has "cathouses" battling for supremacy in a very similar approach to themes presented in Game of Thrones!

And, as they say, "laugh with them".  In that referential context, my Release Notes have been pseudo technical/blog.  It is what it is.  And, unlike working in a certain company's Warehouses, where everything becomes robotic...this most certainly isn't the case with my Releases!  So, here I go again!:)

**RetroArch Xtreme Updated (Mini S-NESC)**

Personal thanks to bslenul, per usual, for bringing forth a quick fix for fix for SNES not working on the
NESC with Canoe in command line.  I also updated the Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets Tethering Command
Line Perimeters into the ReadMe, which can be viewed easily while viewing the Core within hakchi.

**Philips CD-i Support! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

Another one off of the bucket list of Cores we want to get going with the Mini Classics!  Philips CD-i, an
ill-fated system that completely flopped...was home to some almost unbelievable entries in the vein of
Zelda, Mario, and so on!  Yes, Nintendo actually allowed some of their hottest properties to be made
into craptastic games on this Console!  It was meant to be a Multi-Media System!  But, like the 3DO,
both faltered and were usurped pretty quickly by the far superior Playstation One, and its far better
catalog of games and 3rd party support.

**You can now run Philips CD-i with MESS!  Follow these steps:)**

1.  Have latest Injector for AutoBleem/BleemSync installed if on PSC; MESS Dependencies and MESS Core HMODs installed if on NESC/SNESC 

2.  Create a cdimono1 folder wherever you plan on running the CD-i games from, if on PSC

3.  Place cdimono1.zip CD-i BIOS within said folder

4.  Copy and paste whichever CD-i game you'd like to run, also into cdimono1 folder

5.  From CDI_blank.zip, copy the _DUMMY file/s you want for any given game.  These are what will "load" and point to your hard files.  IE: zeldgamu.zip would be selected with MESS Core, in order to load the US version of Zelda: Wand of Gamelon  You would need to have the Zelda: Wand of Gamelon bin+cue or chd within cdimono1 directory

6.  If on NESC/SNESC, things are slightly trickier.  You can run things easily from _DUMMY folder method, obviously!  But, in order to run from the Main UI, you would need to add, as an example, zeldagamu.zip as a game, as is.  Then, navigate to that CLV folder, then create cdimono1 folder, and drag zeldagamu.zip inside of it.  Then, copy the cdimono1.zip BIOS and game you'd like to run into the same folder.  Example command line when done would be:  

/bin/mess /var/games/CLV-Z-NNOEA/cdimono1/zeldagamu.zip

You would need to manually change it to be like this (CLV may vary), then close Hakchi, Reopen, then export.

NOTE: MOST of the _DUMMY files are empty, so you will get an unhandled exception error with hakchi when accessing them.  To get around this, simply create a text file, using notepad, that matches the name of the DUMMY.zip.  For example, burncycl.zip create burncycl.txt and drag it into the burncycl.zip  This is also a workaround I devised awhile back to easily bypass Hakchi's checksum check perimeter.  This is quite helpful in the cases where checksums match.  You can, of course, add these, as is.  And, if the unhandled exception error pops up, simply click continue!

If any of you have issues running these, feel free to ask, and I will do my best to help you along!

**Hyper Duel/Action Hollywood Supported in MAME 2003 Plus! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

Hyper Duel, a fantastic Arcade Game that had been typically played via Sega Saturn in more recent years, is now supported and fully working...great, in fact...via MAME 2003 Plus, along with Action Hollywood, a funny spoof, puzzler game, with an emphasis on Action Movies.  In Xtras/Arcade, you can peruse the updates to MAME 2003 Plus via the _km_mame2003_plus_&_xtreme_compatibility ReadMe!

Some other additions, this time around, are:

- Beathead Fixed
- Tecmo World Cup 96 and Top Players Golf fixed
- Thrash Rally graphical glitches cleaned up
- Small NEO-GEO speed and performance boost
- Wrestling Games: Mat Mania and Exciting Hour graphical glitches fixed
- Ring King/King of Boxer sprite fixes
- Goal92 video fixed up

Refer to the ReadMe! for the rest!  Personal thanks to arcadez and arnoldsecret!

**Cheats Updated! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

I updated Cheats for all Cores that support them, aside from MAME 2003 Plus/Standard/Xtreme, which do not yet need Updated!  Many new entries and fixups...speaking of which!...

**PCSX ReArmed NEON Cheats Fixed! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

Personal thanks to Retro-Wertz for fixing up the Ram issues with some Cheats properly loading and working!  The Updated PCSX ReArmed NEON Core should fare much better with previously stubborn Cheats!  

**PSP Cheats! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

Oft requested, more so, than not!  You can now do "manual" PSP Cheats for all 3 Mini Classics, using PPSSPP Xtreme Core!  In Xtras/PSP, are the files and ReadMe! you will need to help out!

**With PPSSPP Xtreme, you can utilize Cheats!  In order to do this, follow these steps...**

1.  Have latest AutoBleem/BleemSync Injector if on PSC; latest RetroArch Xtreme if on NESC/SNESC

2.  Play any PSP game, then shut down your system.

3.  Your saves directory, within PSP/Cheats, should now contain a fresh and new .ini file.

Example Save Directories:

PSC: AutoBleem - retroarch/saves/PSP/Cheats; BleemSync - bleemsync/opt/retroarch/saves/PSP/Cheats
NESC/SNESC - hakchi/retroarch/saves/PSP/Cheats

Note: PSP/Game can be used for DLC content.

4.  You can amend this .ini file with Notepad or similarly minded program, to manually add Cheats.

5.  The cheat.zip contains a database that you can peruse for exact Cheats that can be added.

6.  CWCheat Database Editor is convenient to be able to quickly access .ini ID numbers, etc.

7.  C0 = OFF; C1 = ON, as far as toggling Cheats.

**Artwork added for PC-Engine CD/Philips CD-i**

In Google Drive Link, Xtras/Artwork.  Personal thanks to EmuMovies and HyperSpin for the incredible Artwork!

**Other Additions! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

Nearly 30+ Cores have been updated with various fixes, optimizations, and so on, for the better benefit of all 3 Mini Consoles!  I will showcase more of these changes within videos, throughout this and next week!

I have fixed up 50+ other things that will also lend credence to a better overall experience with your Minis!

Shaders have been Updated, Controller Configurations, many many other things, to boot!

The four NES Cores that install, by default, with RetroArch Xtreme...for NESC/SNESC, are also now standalone, for those who want the convenience of being able to Update JUST those, and/or use any other RetroArch Versions!  Thanks bslenul for the suggestion!

**The Videos:)!**

Enjoy the Release and have a great week!  I will see you all around, as time permits me to get a few more videos recorded and posted...as well as via responding to your various messages and feedback!  Anything any of you want to see for the Next Update, feel free to request away!  And, due to the complexity of Philips CD-i and PSP Cheats, any of you that have difficulty, be sure to let me know!  

There are some other surprises that made it into this Update that I did not yet reveal!  And, there is a chance we may have some "NEW" Cores working by Next Update, too!  Stay Tuned:)

P.S. Genderbent will Update RetroBoot, accordingly, to account for what I Updated into this Release.  I have provided him with the necessary files:)

Sincerely, KMFDManic...

**7-1-19**

**Another Update:) 7zip assets way below and/or alternate links!**

**Anyone having issues running Midway Games with the AutoBleem Injector, in conjunction with MAME 2003 Xtreme, simply Update to the newest 7-1-19:)

- Core differentials!
- RetroArch Xtreme ReadMe Updated! (Mini S-NESC)
- Multiple Cores Updated (Mini S-NESC-PSC)
- Genesis Plus GX CD-ROM Support!?:) (Mini S-NESC-PSC)
- Stella Updated for even better Homebrew Support! (Mini PSC)
- Nintendo 64 Mupen Plus Next Updated (Mini PSC)

**Core differentials!**

Progressively, due to a combination of the Butterfly Mod Effect, as well as general Open GL limitations, PSC is more capable of running some particular Cores...IE: Dreamcast and PSP!  Ikaruga and Gunlord and Cannon Spike and Dynamite Cop are games that run better on PSC.  Hell, Cannon Spike and Dynamite Cop have so many graphical glitches on S-NESC, that neither are remotely playable!  PSP wise, Ultimate Ghosts'n Goblins and Burnout Legends kick ass on PSC in comparison to S-NESC.  Mupen Plus Next takes advantage of the Open GL3 on PSC, and is more optimized and better overall...considering the still not "too perfect specs!"  Some more Cores may come along in the future, depending on how things work out!  But, OpenBOR, I have a feeling...once we get it going, will have overall better support due to the better memory of the PSC!

**RetroArch Xtreme ReadMe Updated! (Mini S-NESC)**

**This only applies to Mini S-NESC; Personal thanks to bslenul!!!  FCEUmm, Nestopia, QuickNES also Updated!**

While viewed in Hakchi2 CE, you can easily see several of the changes and optimizations!  They are:

# Misc

* Optimizations here and there, should be a bit faster to load/quit RetroArch games.
* Added a workaround for PrBoom saves.

# USB folders changes

* RetroArch stuff on USB should now be in `usb:\hakchi\retroarch`:
    * \database and \playlists if you're using the scanning and playlist features from RetroArch, it's not often used by users on the S/NESC, but its here if you want to!
    * \overlay for additional borders/bezels, drop your .png and .cfg files here.
    * \system to put your BIOS files and/or your samples for MAME cores for examples,  
    it works like the normal system folder on NAND, so if BIOS needs a subfolder you'll need a subfolder too,  
    same for samples, e.g. for MAME2003 you'd have to put your samples in `usb:\hakchi\retroarch\system\mame2003\samples`.
    * \states for the RetroArch save states, note that if the folder doesnt exist states made from the Quick Menu will simply get wiped on exit, just like on NAND.

# New feature to be able to keep RetroArch's save states if you're using NAND

* Being able to keep states made from Quick Menu was a "feature" often requested, simply add `--nand-states` at the end of your command line and this will be possible now!
* Keep in mind that storage is **very** limited on S/NESC so you shouldnt use this on every game...
* Also to not eat all the storage, states are compressed on exit and extracted on launch so it's a bit slower to start/quit RetroArch,  
during my testings it added ~0.7sec on quit with 2 states when exiting a SNES game, and ~0.15sec on launch.
* If you need to remove states for a game, simply FTP to `/var/lib/clover/profiles/0/CLV-ID_OF_THE_GAME` and delete the "ra_states" folder, or just the state inside you want to get rid of.

# Softpatching

* Most people arent even aware this is already a thing, but RetroArch can actually patch your games on the fly, this is compatible with .ips, .ups and .bps,  
here is a list of compatible cores: https://docs.libretro.com/guides/softpatching/#cores-compatibility
* Simply put your .ips/.ups/.bps file in the same folder as your game, **NAMING IS IMPORTANT**, basically you need same filename as your rom, minus last extension, e.g.:
    * if you have a game named `game.gba.7z`, name the patch `game.gba.ips` (or .ups/.bps).
    * if you have a game named `game.gba`, name the patch `game.ips`.
* Softpatching didnt work previously on SNES games because on launch the rom is getting separated from the patch (due to .sfrom -> .sfc conversion needed for RetroArch), now it works fine!  
That was also true for NES games depending on the command line.
* No magic being done tho, you still need a compatible rom for your patch :D

# Default controller options changes

* Added a "#1" and "#2" to `Nintendo Clovercon` name in the autoconfig files, really useful when you want/need to switch port for controllers from the RetroArch menu.
* Left analog to digital turned OFF by default now, this option was a PITA for games that use different actions between dpad and stick, e.g. in GoldenEye 64 you move forward and look down at the same time...
* Autoconfig mapping by default, so now in menus you should see "A" instead of "button 0", "D-Pad Up" instead of "button 13", etc.

# Bezel-mode and overlays changes

* For those who dont know, bezel-mode is a mode that will use currently selected SNESC border and will fit the game image into it.  
It will also change resolution and filters depending on video mode selected on the SNES UI, e.g. CRT will have scanlines and bilinear filtering.  
Due to the shape of the borders, this is obviously not meant for games like GBA, PSP, vertical SHMUPs, etc., or image will be completely distorded.
* Having `--bezel-mode` in command line or holding L-button while starting a game will activate bezel-mode for that game.
* Holding R-button while starting a game will activate bezel-mode for the current core instead of EVERY game like before, which makes more sense.
* Optional command lines (only works with bezel-mode ON):
    * `--enable-scanlines` to activate scanlines while 4:3 or Pixel Perfect mode is selected.
    * `--no-scanlines` to disable scanlines in CRT mode.
    * `--enable-smooth` to activate bilinear filtering while 4:3 or Pixel Perfect mode is selected.
    * `--no-smooth` to disable bilinear filtering in CRT mode.
* Without bezel-mode, overlay is disabled by default, if you want to turn it ON it is in `Quick Menu > Onscreen Overlay`, there are 3 presets:
    * `border.cfg`, this one will use the current border selected on SNES UI.
    * `scanlines.cfg` is a scanlines overlay (not as good as a shader, but less demanding), no borders.
    * `border_with_scanlines.cfg` is current selected border + scanlines applied to it.

**Genesis Plus GX CD-ROM Support!?:) (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

I have not personally been able to test this, as of yet.  But, you should now theoretically be able to connect a CD-ROM device and run an actual Sega-CD game via the Core!  If anyone is able to test and can confirm this works for any of the 3 Minis, be sure to let me know!

**Stella Updated for even better Homebrew Support! (Mini PSC)**

This is ONLY for PSC, for now:)  Better Homebrew Support, as well as some video fixes!

**Nintendo 64 Mupen Plus Next Updated (Mini PSC)**

Mini PSC, for now:)  Fixes loading issues for some.

**Enjoy the Update:)**

**6-30-19**

Only one thing updated, Stella for S-NESC:)  Thanks to durpdurp420 and bslenul for heads up and testing:)  You can grab from the primary Release, and/or alternative Google Drive/hakchi.net links, or KMFD Mod Hub within hakchi.  It will be dated 6-30-19.

**6-26-19**

**Actually, I typoed bit mapping, as it was supposed to be bit masking...which is essentially a more optimal way of calculating values in just one step, rather than multiple variables.  This helps processes, such as execute, read, write, and so on...work more effortlessly.**

**Welcome back:)  I've spent a great deal of my life sitting on the sidelines, being a spectator, as many around me were experiencing life as a reality.  Life truly is too short to waste in such a way.  And, of course, it isn't the easiest!  It can be quite a harsh place with unforeseen circumstances.  That being said, real life may be taking over for a little bit.  You will still be able to get ahold of me via the various methods, such as Discord, YouTube, Reddit, etc!** 

**7zip assets at way bottom, or any of the alternative links!**

- PPSSPP Standard, Xtreme, Reicast Xtreme, Flycast, Lightning Fast Game Exiting! (Mini S-NESC)
- RetroArch Xtreme Overhauled yet again! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)
- DraStic for AutoBleem PSC:)!
- NEW Core!  TIC-80! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)
- Other additions, fixes, etc! Final Notes!:)

**PPSSPP Standard, Xtreme, Reicast Xtreme, Flycast, Lightning Fast Game Exiting! (Mini S-NESC)**

The old method of loading a Dummy Core for PPSSPP Standard, such as 2048 or Mr.Boom is no longer needed!  And, the 10-15 second exits of PPSSPP Xtreme won't be a problem anymore, either!  Personal thanks to bslenul for painstakingly helping to pinpoint the cause to be a hefty uncompression of a useless save file!  You can now save either in-game or via RetroArch Saves.  Same thing goes for Reicast Xtreme and Flycast!  Initially, I was using a workaround to instantly kill the memory to exit faster.  This is far superior!

**RetroArch Xtreme Overhauled yet again! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

**Mini S-NESC Side!**

Myself and bslenul overhauled the one for Mini S-NESC!  It is a beautiful piece of work, with quite a few fix-ups.  It is probably running more optimally, bigger, badder, better, than any previous RetroArch Release we have put out within the last 2+ years!  You can do such things as run bios, thumbnails, samples, etc. from USB, by creating:

hakchi/retroarch/thumbnails or hakchi/retroarch/system .  Samples would be in hakchi/retroarch/system/mame2003/samples/samples here!  So, knock yourself out with the amazing Custom OSTs that work with MAME 2003 Xtreme, such as Final Fight, OutRun, Mortal Kombat, Michael Jackson's Moonwalker, Double Dragon, and NBA Jam!  The Release note from previous Release, again...referring to this magic is:

- moved the RA stuff on USB to usb:\hakchi\retroarch so its cleaner than having usb:\hakchi\borders, \samples, etc.  so for example usb:\hakchi\retroarch\system will now "merge" with /etc/libretro/system, so you can put your bios, samples, etc. here directly, just like on NAND.  Same goes for usb:\hakchi\retroarch\overlay, usb:\hakchi\retroarch\playlists and usb:\hakchi\retroarch\database 

If you happen to run into any systems that do not work with BIOS on hakchi/retroarch/system, simply remove those and run from Master BIOS Module  This could potentially occur from certain read only permissions issues, depending on the type of flash drive/hard drive/format/OTG you use.  I had one drive not properly read /hakchi/retroarch/system/dc (Dreamcast BIOS).  But, every other drive did, just fine.  I simply ran the dc bios from Master BIOS Module, in internal NAND flash memory instead, on the problem drive.  Execution wise, everything should work great, as our tests, and those who helped us test...had no issues!  

**Mini PSC Side!**

On the PSC side, genderbent did some amazing work.  And, I added my own personal touch to things.   If using the AutoBleem side of things, you will be enjoying some nice performance and speed optimizations, better video driver support (glcore; which also has new .slang shaders to go along with it!!)...which lends credence to even better running Sega Dreamcast, PSP, and PS1, etc. games!  Try out Ultimate Ghosts'n Goblins and Burnout Legends for PSP to see a nice difference, as primary examples!  These are two of the most stubborn and incredibly difficult games to run!  I also recommend 3rd Birthday AKA Parasite Eve 3!  What makes glcore better?  Well, standard gl when pushed too far, has audio/video issues that can lead to severe graphical glitches or flickering screens!  PSP is the number one candidate for this problem, which is one reason I have maintained PPSSPP Standard on the Mini S-NESC, since it is less affected with the older video set-up.  Now, you get the best of both worlds...PPSSPP Xtreme running the stubborn games even better with fewer hiccups!  Obviously, this won't do a thing to help you run any of the God of War games!  

  As per usual, install whichever modification, then the injector of your choice...be it AutoBleem/BleemSync!  This time around, you get an additional bonus!

**DraStic for AutoBleem PSC:)!**

Personal thanks to Exophase, the original author, as well as the efforts of MMC and genderbent.  Upon installing the AutoBleem Modification, then the AutoBleem injector, you can finally install the Drastic for AutoBleem injector!  Then, when you go to load Cores, you will have a nifty new DraStic Core to work with, complete with a beefed up Xtreme Cheat Code implementation!  You can use a 2nd controller to easily program touch screen and other such movements.  I use 2 controllers to get all into the mix, or all work fine on a PS4 style controller with analogs, too!  Obviously, some games will not be fully playable, since they require "white noise" from a mic...Zelda has candles that need blown out.  Metroid has "slash controls" that inhibit getting to certain areas. 
 But, you can still use cheats in games like this and Metroid, to get past the stuck areas, due to this limitation.

**Midway/Atari/Vector, etc Games fixed-up for MAME 2003 Xtreme! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

With RetroArch Xtreme installed for any of the 3 systems, be it Core wise or via injector, in conjunction with MAME 2003 Xtreme, the following games will now work!

**NEW Core!  TIC-80! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

This is a really fun Core, of which I included a few games in Xtras/Games/TIC-80.  You can easily find these online, too, including a great Super Hexagon remake, albeit without the music of the amazing original!  This is one of DanTheMan827's favorite go to games (the original, that this one is based off of!)  So, be sure to check it out!  There are several other considerable efforts, too, including Super Meat Boy and Metroid Vania and various SHMUP inspired fares to check out.  Again, these are super easily found online!  Just be sure to rename the cart.tic files when you download them, so you can distinguish which is which!  Personal thanks to Madmonkey for helping out on this one, as well as RobLoach (who also worked on the great Chailove!) and nesbox from libretro!  And, absolutely huge thanks to the creativity juices of all who made games that work with this great Core!

/bin/tic80 if on S-NESC!  Just load if on PSC:)

**Enjoy the Update!  Sincerely, KMFDManic!**

**P.S.  Again, the best way to communicate with me, if need be, will be via Discord, YouTube, Reddit, or direct line, if you have it:)  Have a great weekend!**

**6-23-19**

Some real life drama to contend with, for the time being.  But, rest assured, some great and noteworthy stuff will make the very next Update, including more awesomeness from an even more updated and tweaked and optimized RetroArch Xtreme!  What is RetroArch Xtreme, you may ask?  That is a very valid question.  It is essentially RetroArch, as many know it, on many different platforms...But, for our lower spec hardwares on NESC/SNESC/PSC, some additional alterations, adjustments, modifications, tweaks, persay, are thrown into the mix to up the ante, to a degree.  This helps with running many Games/Cores bigger, badder, and better.  Additionally, of the many and numerous requests over the last two+ years, many of these make it into Retroarch...or even out of RetroArch...such as with the "loading screens" that a good 150+ people griped about not wanting.  

In the case of the Notifications, which I detailed how to disable in the last release...more people wanted and preferred them to not.  They really are extremely helpful with troubleshooting and knowing a set-up is good and proper.  But, they are easily disabled, as mentioned!  Again, RetroArch Xtreme, like Hakchi2 CE, is for the Community at large, and based very much on many of your personal requests, as well as personal touches from myself, bslenul, DanTheMan827, and of course madmonkey!  And, on the PSC side, genderbent, whom works with RetroBoot, and I collaborate with on a regular basis...as well as AutoBleem (who I also collaborate with)/BleemSync, and so on!  

What about PSpwned?  Well, the original idea I had about it being worked into Hakchi, is the most likely outcome, at this point.  My original demonstration of how it could potentially work with hakchi got a ton of positive response, and truly helped in the path that PSpwned would finally take.  It also will no longer be referred to as PSpwned.  It will simply, when everything is said and done, be part of Hakchi, nothing more, nothing less:)

Have a great weekend, guys and gals!  I will try to get the Update finished, along with some more videos, throughout the course of this week.  Much deliberation is going into certain aspects of the next Update, due to some amazing User Feedback responses!  Just you wait til you see some of the pure awesomeness to come!

Sincerely, Kyland!  

**6-17-19**

Minor Update:)  

- AutoBleem/BleemSync Injectors Updated (Mini PSC) (Performance/Speed Boost)
- AutoBleem Injector Default PS1 Games Playlist Fixed (Mini PSC)
- PCSX ReArmed NEON Updated & RetroArch Xtreme Updated (Mini S-NES) (Performance/Speed Boost)

Grab the Injectors from either alternative link above.  And, you can get the updated PCSX ReArmed NEON for Mini S-NES from either link, as well as KMFD Mod Hub.  Of course, Main Release contains all of the above, too:)

Again, thank you dragonknife for heads up on AutoBleem Playlist.  

**6-16-19 Hot Fix Update**

**Per usual, 7zip assets link way at bottom of this page!  Or, use alternative links!**

**Hello everyone:)  As, per usual, we listen to feedback anytime something new is posted!**

So, here is an interum **Hot Fix** Update, as there likely will not be another "Full Fledged" one for at least another week or few.  You can go to the Google Drive Link, KMFD Mod Hub in Hakchi2 CE, or the Main Release...to grab just the updated files...Then, simply apply them to your current set-up!  Thank you all for your amazing feedback.  It goes a tremendously long way as far as truly helping make the Core Set Releases what they are!  Thanks bslenul for prioritizing fix-ups for RetroArch Xtreme, so everyone can have a happy day:)  Hoping to have this working for Next Update, too!  Preview Pic:)

**Now then, for the specifics!:)**

- DraStic Fixed Up!

- NEO-CD Fixed Up!

- FBA NEO is now FB NEO!

- FBA 2012, 2012 CPS1/2/3,NEO, 2016 are now renamed to FB Alpha 2012, etc.!

- RetroArch Xtreme Updated!

- Master BIOS Module, etc, repost!

**DraStic**

Simply redownload and reinstall:)

Command lines are /bin/drastic for 2.5.3 (better performance; /bin/drastic-mic for Mic games:)

Some Mic games still have areas you might need to "blow out" candles, etc.  I would suggest trying to use "cheats" or importing saves from the Android version to bypass these.  Hopefully, we can figure out a "white noise" button:)  

Personal thanks to Arohan and Pascal Koch for the heads up on install issues with DraStic.  All fixed now:)

**NEO-CD Fixed Up!**

Simply redownload and reinstall.  Command line is:

/bin/neocd

Again, BIOS are now:

NEO-CD = neocd folder = 000-lo.lo, neocd.bin, uni-bioscd.rom

000-lo.lo from neogeo.zip and neocd.bin from neocdz.zip and uni-bioscd, easily found online:)

If you need any help, be sure to let me know!  Personal thanks to AntiFly and Edjuh for helping test!

**FBA NEO is now FB NEO!**

FBA AKA FinalBurn Alpha transcended into FB NEO AKA FinalBurn NEO for various reasons.  Simply delete km_fbaneo from user_mods, etc, and replace with _km_fbneo.hmod  Command lines are:

- /bin/fba (this is standard for if you only have ONE single FinalBurn Core installed)
- /bin/fbneo (I also have /bin/fba2018 automatically set to use FB NEO, as FBA 2018 is merged into NEO.

Personal thanks to nava and lanlcon for helping test FB NEO:)

**FBA 2012, 2012 CPS1/2/3,NEO, 2016 are now renamed to FB Alpha 2012, etc.!**

One pet peeve I personally have is that I like for the Cores to be listed chronologically.  With FBA 2012 and FB NEO, FB NEO would come first.  So, I changed them to their more appropriate names and ordering:

- FB Alpha 2012
- FB Alpha 2012 CPS1
- FB Alpha 2012 CPS2
- FB Alpha 2012 CPS3
- FB Alpha 2016 (FBA)
- FB NEO

**RetroArch Xtreme Updated!**

RetroArch has been Tweaked to be more and more optimal for the Mini Classics, over time, especially due to the incredible amount of feedback you all have been giving on a day to day basis!  Expect even more touch ups for the Next Update.  But, for this one, in addition to yesterday's Update, you now have:

- automatic bilinear and scanlines if CRT mode is selected (thanks bslenul:)
- Bezel Mode touch ups (thanks again, bslenul:)

Personal thanks to bolton80 for helping test:)

**Master BIOS Module, etc, repost!**

I do "size audits" each Update to verify the overall size of any given HMOD.  If you have any of these in user_mods folder, delete them and replace with the Updated ones.  Just grab updated ones, as mentioned, from Google Drive, Main Release, or KMFD Mod Hub:)

**RetroArch Xtreme Overhaul! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

**Mini S-SNESC-PSC, wise:)**

Myself and bslenul had been cleaning and touching up RetroArch Xtreme so it is vastly more stable and optimal.  In testing, I have been getting C8 and other such errors less than normally expected.  Still, stuff like PSP games on Mini S-NESC...avoid shutting down after playing one (C8 may occur).  I would recommend loading a less intensive game, such as NES, THEN shutting down.  

bslenul did a tremendous job helping out with this, and everything, as a whole, is running so much better:)  He helped fix up saves, and so on:)  Here are just some of the incredible changes he put forth:)

- cleaned up a bit, removing unneeded stuff, tweaking (it does way less writing on NAND, especially with bezel-mode), etc. so it may be a bit quicker to load/quit.

- controller changed so that autoconfig files work as intended.  Also, added "#1" and "#2" to the clovercon names so that its less confusing in RA menus.

- changed bezel-mode like I did with RA Neo in the past: L on start toggle for game, R for core (not EVERY game anymore, which seemed a bit pointless tbh).

- moved the RA stuff on USB to usb:\hakchi\retroarch so its cleaner than having usb:\hakchi\borders, \samples, etc.  so for example usb:\hakchi\retroarch\system will now "merge" with /etc/libretro/system, so you can put your bios, samples, etc. here directly, just like on NAND.  Same goes for usb:\hakchi\retroarch\overlay, usb:\hakchi\retroarch\playlists and usb:\hakchi\retroarch\database  

**I, KMFDManic made it so thumbnails run from usb:/hakchi/thumbnails due to potential character limit conflicts.  More on that in the "thumbnails" portion of this Release!:)  I also employed the use of /bin/fceumm-legacy for those who have "older" NES saves, due to the changing of format handling, as far as how saves now work with newer FCEUmm!  Use /bin/fceumm-legacy for OLD, preexisting NES saves; /bin/fceumm for any NEW ones!  Personal thanks to Patton for testing the NES saves!**

- added a new command line: --nand-states to enable RA save states on NAND, of course this isnt recommended for cores with huge states.  The states are extracted on load and compressed on quit to save on space so it may take a little longer to load/quit with the command line, from my tests 2 states with a SNES game add ~0.15 second on launch and ~0.7 second on close.

- for states on USB you simply need usb:\hakchi\retroarch\states folder to activate the feature, with the .state* files directly here (no subfolders)  States on USB are not compressed and already existing states are symlinked directly from this folder so its pretty quick.

- added ips/bps/ups softpatching support for games that are launched from /tmp/rom (SNES games, Kachikachi games using --retroarch, etc.), just like other compatible cores, drop your patch in the same folder as your rom and sync.  If the game is named game.gba.7z your patch should be named game.gba.ips (or .bps/.ups), if game is named game.gba then just game.ips, this is important, incorrect naming wont work!
list of compatible cores: 

[https://docs.libretro.com/guides/softpatching/#cores-compatibility](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/softpatching/#cores-compatibility)

- Several other things were done in the overhaul, both by me and bslenul.  You will have a far better, overall experience with Your Mini Classic experience, as a whole.  We could practically write a book with the sheer amount of changes that may typically go into any given Update!

We will see how things go, and possibly, if need be...change some perimeters as far as the harmonious relationship between NAND/USB, in a future Release!

**Mini PSC, wise:)**

- Only things that were optimal for usage on PSC were carried over.  So, as a result, you will still enjoy the better overall experience trifold!  May this carry over into the Mini Genesis and Turbografx-16 Mini Platforms, as well!  Yes, Turbografx-16 Mini is happening, next year!

**So, thanks everyone for your great feedback, and enjoy the overhauled RetroArch Xtreme!**

**AutoBleem and BleemSync Xtreme Core/Cheat Set Injectors (Mini PSC)**

Due to the sheer amount of people who have been messaging me on a daily basis, I have updated Injectors for both AutoBleem and BleemSync! They are in Main Release, PS CLASSIC Folder, as well as in both alternative links.  Enjoy!  Thanks to the AutoBleem and BleemSync development Teams for their great work!  Genderbent will update RetroBoot soon, too, also with the latest additions I provide him from this Release, as well as other additional bonuses for that specific Modification!

**Who the "Hell" Loves DOOM:)!? (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

Many of you might be trying to load the SNES, N64, etc, ports of DOOM.  But, you can actually run the PC versions of DOOM 1, 2, FreeDOOM, Plutonia, TNT, and now:

**Even better, how about DOOM SIGIL!? (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

**Due to time constraints, the Tutorial Video for this will show up on my YouTube channel, after the Update!**

Using PrBoom, you can run the aforementioned games, as well as the great Add-On that John Romero has painstakingly worked on for roughly 2 years, now!  I added it to the KMFD Mod Hub, in Games Tab.  You need only copy and paste the FULL, not shareware, version of DOOM 1 (recommended named as doom.wad to the resulting CLV download.  If you want to run the amazing Buckethead OST, you can simply copy those appropriately named mp3s into the same folder!

This was a pretty big undertaking, as there were quite a few issues, initially.  But, Ferk helped get the mp3 support going, bslenul and myself underwent quite a bit of testing, especially bslenul, a huge DOOM connoisseur for many years!  Lastly, madmonkey helped on a bug related to malloc/free/access errors.  One side effect of this bug was certain numbers of characters, limit wise, would crash the Core..preventing games from fully loading! loading!  

In Xtras/DOOM, is all you need tutorial wise, and more:)  I would recommend sticking to mp3 format if you want to run the OST, on the Mini S-NES.  The SHREDS_SIGIL.wad takes longer to unpack and can lead to memory issues and potential crashing.  A tool, "wadext, for "wad extraction" is included to extract SHREDS_SIGIL, if need be.  Then, simply rename the .lmp files to .mp3! The proper names are as follow (Be sure to check out Xtras/DOOM, for more information!  You can even run "other" OSTs!):

**SIGIL (Buckethead OST!):** 

e5m1.mp3  (1. Romero One Mind Any Weapon (9:04)

e5m2.mp3  (2. 13th Floor (7:15)

e5m3.mp3  (3. Buildor 2 (13:44)

e5m4.mp3  (4. The Patrolman (7:30)

e5m5.mp3  (5. Cold Frost Part 6 (5:10)

e5m6.mp3  (6. Melting Man Part 2 (6:38)

e5m7.mp3  (7. Far 5 (10:41)

e5m8.mp3  (8. Posedion 4-6 (16:56)

e5m9.mp3  (9. Fastpass (7:04)

inter.mp3 (Eye on Spiral Part 1 (5:18) (doesn't come with mp3 purchase; but, does with SIGIL_SHREDS.wad)

intro.mp3 (Triceratoptron (3:31) (doesn't come with mp3 purchase; but, does with SIGIL_SHREDS.wad)

**Enjoy SIGIL, DOOM, BUCKETHEAD!  And, thanks again, Ferk, bslenul, madmonkey, John Romero, id Software, and all those who worked on PrBoom Core, as well as the original Creator, Florian Schulze!

**2 Player Mode Activate! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

**Due to time constraints, the Tutorial Video for this will show up on my YouTube channel, after the Update!**

As per the previous video demonstrations of this, in action...as well as the videos below...you will have ability to run 2-4 player games, with only ONE single controller! 

**More awesome games on KMFD Mod Hub, Games Tab!:)**

The prototype for the unreleased SNES game Atmosfear.  Personal thanks to The Hidden Palace for digging up this long lost treasure made by Beam Software, the same company responsible for games such as Radical Rex and Shadowrun.  The Killing Game Show: Fatal Rewind, made by an earlier Bizarre Creations, is an interesting side scrolling actioner with a twist.  I thank them for publicly making this one available.  Also a huge fan of their other games, such as Project Gotham and Blur!  DOOM SIGIL and DOOM 1 also on the Hub!  Lastly, a couple more great NES games, such as Alter Ego, a port of the original (by Denis Grachev for the ZX Spectrum.  Thank you, Shiru!  Shiru also did Lawn Mower.  Enjoy!

My goal is to try to get some games for every Core that I can, so it is easier for you guys and gals to test them!  I will have many more for the Next Update!

**OpenBOR Becomes Even More Badass! (Compatibility Update; Mini S-NES)**

This is, more or less, an update to help with memory issues and general C7/C8 errors that might occur.  There is also a compatibility list that myself, bslenul, and DRVR 99 worked on, in Xtras/OPENBOR!  Thanks to all of you who have given me great feedback on various testing of OpenBOR games, as well!  Also, in Xtras/OPENBOR, be sure to check back, as I will throw some .pak games in there for you guys and gals to grab.  There are some there, now, for this Release!  They will be changed out intermittently.  Also, check Xtras/GAMES folder, as games will show up there, as well!  There will be no magical solution to games that do not work or crash.  It is due to a combination of memory limitations of the Mini S-NES, and whichever original build/assets the games were coded with.  But, what works now, is pretty fantastic...nonetheless:)

Douglas Baldan AKA O Ilusionista, who worked on the great Avengers: United Battle Force for many years, now!...has been very helpful and gracious with OpenBOR troubleshooting, as far as some of the games not working!  His most current version, which I showed in a video, can be played perfectly on PC OpenBOR!  You can grab it at:

[https://gamejolt.com/games/avengers-united-battle-force/14591](https://gamejolt.com/games/avengers-united-battle-force/14591)

The version that works for us on the Minis, I will provide him with, so he can have it linked to on his site, as well!  In the meantime, you can grab it from Xtras/OPENBOR!

I will update the Xtras/OPENBOR to link to more fantastic games, and/or include them in said folder!

ZVitor has some fantastic games, as well.  This one plays perfectly on the Mini with this Update:)

[https://gamejolt.com/games/marvel-infinity-war/201435](https://gamejolt.com/games/marvel-infinity-war/201435)

**Core Consolidation! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

Snes9x 2016 is no longer needed.  Snes9x AKA Snes9x will be the merge of the recent rebase.  FBA 2018 is also no longer needed.  FBA NEO will take its place  FBA 2016 is still needed, as CPS3 and many other games run much better on it than on FBA 2018/NEO!  CPS3 also works great on FBA 2012:)  PCSX ReArmed NEON Standard is scratched from the Release, as NEON/PEOPS/UNAI have all been fixed up so it is no longer needed!  Reicast will only have Reicast Xtreme, no more need for Accuracy or Standard.  NEW Dreamcast will be Flycast, as per the next section.  Lastly, PPSSPP Standard/Xtreme will both remain.  Standard is still needed for some games.

**NEW Dreamcast & FinalBurn Alpha Cores! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

FBA 2018 will be replaced by FBA NEO; Reicast Accuracy/Standard by Flycast

/bin/fbaneo and /bin/flycast respectively.  Reicast Xtreme will still use /bin/reicast

**PS1 Cores Fixed Up! (Video Stuttering Cleaned Up; Mini S-NES-PSC)**

PCSX Standard is now gone and no longer needed.  NEON/PEOPS/UNAI are cleaned up with better speed, performance, less stuttering with FMVs, etc!  Quake 2 and some other broken games now work again with NEON!  

Command lines for S-NES Users are:

**_km_pcsx_rearmed_neon**

  - /bin/pcsx  <clover_args> (triggers NEON Mode Activate!
  - /bin/pcsx-neon  <clover_args> (triggers NEON Mode Activate!
  - /bin/pcsx-peops  <clover_args> (triggers PEOPS Mode Activate!
  - /bin/pcsx-unai  <clover_args> (triggers UNAI Mode Activate!

Now then, more fix-ups for PS1:)

**Let's do PS1 even one better, and finally have Jedi Power Battles fully working! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

Video below shows the fix in action!  But, essentially, we now have a NEON Core Option to "disable SMC
checks", on the fly!  This will remain only in NEON, for the time being!

This has been a problem for 2+ years now!  Jedi Power Battles always crashes in 30 seconds, give or take.  It simply desynchs the audio+video, and freezes, then crashes!  

Last year, I was working on a potential solution for it, via overclocking, which helped fix Parasite Eve 2, NBA Live 98, 2000, 2001, and other select games.  I reverted this fix for the time being because it hurt FMV in some other games, such as Tomb Raider and Crash Bandicoot! 

And, thanks retro-wertz for the truly excellent collaboration and helping with the implementation of the appropriate and theoretical fixes and FMV fix-ups (now officially deemed to work great, as per this video:)!  Thank you bslenul for the graciousness of helping test these broken games and trying to arrive at nice placeholder solutions, especially helping determine Looney Tunes: Sheep Raider was also affected by same dilemma criteria issue as Jedi!  Thank you ReyVGM for his great testing with some of these fixes, too!  Thank you madmonkey, as well...for his collaboration and entertaining my original ideas of overclocking, last year...as being potential but not guaranteed fixes!  Last, but not least, thank all of you who are now watching this!   And, definitely thanks to some of you who share the now obsolute Pandora device philosophy of emulation.  The Pandora is still quite effective at troubleshooting some of the broken games, that caveats generally and effectively hurt us, elsewhere!:)  RetroPie has inherently taking the throne, in that respect.  But, Pandora will always have a place, close to my heart:)

**Speaking of Overclocking:) (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

The butterfly mod effect strikes, yet again.  The games that were solved by trying to fix Jedi Power Battles, last year...include NBA Live 98, 2000, 2001, and Parasite Eve 2, amongst others.  I temporarily reverted that fix due to audio/synch issues on some games.  But, retro-wertz and gingerbeardman helped in cleaning those up.  You now have a Core Option in NEON/PEOPS/UNAI, to change clock from default 57 to 70 to fix these games!  Set back to 57 when done:)

Ruby Eye Shabranigdu brought it to my attention that the great Crusaders of Might and Magic also has issues.  bslenul was nice enough to test that one and the combination of Updated Release, and both fixes..."disable SMC checks" and "overclock set to 100", prevent the game from immediately crashing, and it becomes "playable, to a degree".  Feedback and testing always go a long way.  Who knows what other games still need fixed or cleaned up!  Always looking forward to more responses, to help account for these stubborn games!  

So, in effect, with this Release, and some great detective work, up to 200+ more games have a chance of working better or more optimally, as well as even working to begin with!

**PS1 Controller Issues!? (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

Thanks Meowthed for the heads up on Silhouette Mirage controller issues.  bslenul and myself arrived at a solution, which I showcase in the video below.  This may or may not be immediately fixed up, Core Wise.  But, game/s with this issue can be played easily, using this methodology!  Simply go into RetroArch Settings, Controls, Set Pad 1 Type to Dual Shock.  Switch back when done:)  Should be Standard by default:)

**N64 Cores Fixed Up! (Performance Tweaked; Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

Thanks to m4xw, who did some great work on Mupen Plus Next for the Nintendo Switch...plus the great assistance of madmonkey and helpful tips from CompCom, we now have a much better working Mupen Plus Next:

**Before on Mupen Plus Next:**

[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/398086837182267392/589378682171293696/20190609_182755.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/398086837182267392/589378682171293696/20190609_182755.jpg)

**After on Mupen Plus Next:**

[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/398086837182267392/589378753537376276/20190614_213740.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/398086837182267392/589378753537376276/20190614_213740.jpg)

Not only that, nearly every N64 game that is supported, works more optimally, faster, badder, and better than before.  Obviously, due to memory limitations, especially on the S-NESC, all 3 systems can have certain games freeze or crash.  Memory leaks are something we can temporarily contain, but not completely control, for the time being!  Zram Crash Inhibitor greatly helps on S-NESC!  You can refer to my Killer Instinct N64 Video Tutorial to help, otherwise!

I also cleaned up Glupen, Parallel, Mupen Plus, and Mupen Plus Next to have better and more optimal speed, performance, and whatnot:)  Try F-Zero X and see just how beautifully it runs on Glupen, Mupen Plus, and Mupen Plus Next, and Mario 64 on Parallel!  You can also now play Majora's Mask and Conker's Bad Fur Day and several other previously problematic games (within reason!) on Mupen Plus Next!  I will try to prioritize looking into 64DD for the next Release or two!

**Killer Instinct N64, Better Performance:) (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

**Due to time constraints, the Tutorial Video for this will show up on my YouTube channel, after the Update!**

Killer Instinct N64 has proven to be one of the more difficult games to run, at all...on the Mini Classics.  On Mini S-NESC, it would always crash in seconds; PSC, slow down to a crawl, then crash, in short time!  I made it a personal goal to try to get this running better.  So, with the Updated Cores, in conjunction with a little additional magic, you can play this a hell of a lot better, especially on PSC!  It will play better, but not quite as good...on the S-NESC!

**Boxart & Screenshot Support with Playlists! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

**Due to time constraints, the Tutorial Video for this will show up on my YouTube channel, after the Update!**

You can now have the amazing convenience of nifty Boxart/Screenshots while viewing games on your Playlists, via RetroArch.  For Mini S-NESC, you will need RetroArch Xtreme Database HMOD installed.  For PSC, the injector for AutoBleem/BleemSync.

Once that is said and done, you can go to Xtras/thumbnails, and grab the ones you want.  Copy them to hakchi/thumbnails for S-NESC

 and

retroarch/thumbnails for PSC AutoBleem, and opt/.config/retroarch/thumbnails for PSC BleemSync  After copying said archives, extract them "here" into the specific thumbnails folders!

Then, simply "import/scan files/directories" for new content, and you will see applicable artwork for boxarts and screenshots for the games that are pulled up in the database!

Mini S-NESC users can create a _DUMMY folder in the outset of the flash drive, and navigate to it easily from RetroArch Settings, Parent Folder, Media, _DUMMY, scan:)  Enjoy!  Speaking of RetroArch Settings!?

Personal thanks to tgenius for helping test things.  And, also, IncendiaryIdea...who equally wanted to make thumbnails as optimal as possible for Mini Classics Usage:)

I have them cleaned up from an original 36 GB down to a nice, barely 7 GB set:)  Much more manageable for Flash/Hard Drive usage, without a doubt!

**RetroArch Notifications and Achievements!? (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

These are on, by default, as they are quite pertinent to troubleshooting, as well as a great convenience in helping know things are fully and properly operational!  In the event you do not want these enabled, simply do the following:

Note 1: RetroAchievements are off by default due to it taking longer to load games if one does not have
WI-FI Connectivity.  Enable simply by going into RetroArch Settings, Achievements, toggling ON.

Note 2: To Disable Notifications and Menu Widgets, go into RetroArch Settings, close content, then:

- Settings, User Interface, Menu Widgets Off
- Settings, Onscreen Display, Onscreen Notifications Off

Finally, Exit RetroArch, and Notifications and Menu Widgets should now be Off.

You can also Load RetroArch, without content, to pull off these changes!  RetroArch UI from Games Tab in Hakchi2 CE for Mini S-NESC users, and from the get go for PSC users!

**New Alternative Link for Core Set Release & Xtras! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

I migrated everything over to Google Drive, and you will see a plethora more content, not to mention experience better downloads and navigation!  The link for the new alternative is at way top of this Release!

**Hakchi2 CE Select Emulation Core WIP (Mini S-NESC)**

I touched this up as a WIP for the very next Hakchi update.  So, upon that Release, you will be able to right click and set nearly every Core in my Release.  Expect this change in the near future.  You can still manually set any that do not show up, and follow the appropriate command lines as determined in ReadMe of each specific Core, whilst viewed in Hakchi, as well as the Xtras/COMMANDS!

**NEO-GEO CD CHD Support! (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

First Genesis Plus GX, then Turbografx-CD, then PS1...CHD is a fantastic space saver, compression format, that allows you to get close to zipped proportions, size wise.  NEO-GEO CD makes the cut, this time around!  You can still use the conversion script in Xtras/TOOLS/chdman (bin+cue), amongst other means.  BIOS are also changed up, slightly.  You will need:

NEO-CD = neocd folder = 000-lo.lo, neocd.bin, uni-bioscd.rom

000-lo.lo from neogeo.zip and neocd.bin from neocdz.zip and uni-bioscd, easily found online:)

Personal thanks to Fabrice Martinez for helping with the CHD implementation, madmonkey for helping with the execution, and bslenul for helping test things and also helping sort out the most optimal bios usage!  

**Speaking of BIOS!:) (Mini S-NESC-PSC)**

Justme488 and myself updated the Xtras/BIOS/Print_Friendly_BIOS_Cheat_Sheet.pdf!  This will greatly help you be on a better path, knowing what need, for any given Core that typically requires BIOS!

**WIP!:)**

I am personally hoping to get more handheld games going!  That is my next thing to look into:)  Genderbent and madmonkey will be helping fix up DraStic for better End User experience for PSC!  Expect that in the near future:)  ScummVM will get a nice touch up, and I will showcase that after this Update!  I have other stuff running, that I will also demonstrate

And, I will still try to get to Nintendo Power.  Just keep getting sidetracked:)

**Closing Notes!:)**

Was trying to catch up on a few movies.  Despite awful reviews, I still gave Dark Phoenix a chance:)  I won't get into spoilers.  But, to me, it came across as a modest mixture of Brightburn/Captain Marvel, hehe:)  Godzilla was a fun movie, and it will be nice to see the franchise keep going.  Again, without spoiling anything, I am already seeing they are "hopefully" planning on a 2020 Godzilla vs. King Kong movie:)  Catching up on Black Mirror, season 5, has only 3 episodes.  1st one, to say the least, is a very different take on Tekken style VR game play, hehe:)  

Be sure to join us on Discord, if you'd like to personally talk to us and get assistance!  I will be catching up on messages from all of you from the last few days, as well:)

**Enjoy the Update!  Signing out, for now, KMFDManic!:)**

**5-31-19**  

It is that time again...gearing up for yet another tremendous Update!  Expect some videos over the weekend, and Release soon after:)  2 Player Mode Activate, More OpenBOR, fixed up PS1 and N64 Cores, and so on!  See you all soon:)

Thanks to all of you who have joined us and become a part of our daily conversations!  Looking forward to chatting with more of you in the future!

You all know how this works, by now:)!  Without spoiling anything, I caught up on a few movies and tv shows in the interim between the last and this Update!  Avengers: Endgame met my expectations, and I didn't think it would be too easy to match the entertainment value of that movie.  But, I found Shazam a fun diversion, as well.  Mark Strong was in top form, as always.  He was one of the sole redeeming factors in the failed Green Lantern movie, along with, of course...Ryan Reynolds typical snarky and fun attitude!  And, of course, Ryan met his life mate, Blake Lively, in the process!  Game of Thrones is still holding strong, with one final episode left!  In any case, let's get to this Update, before I get anymore sidetracked!

**RetroArch Xtreme Updated to 1.7.7 for Mini NES/SNES/PSC!**

**BleemSync Injector will post on 5-19-18.  Check back for an Update for that, specifically!  Unfortunately, time constraints kept me from finishing it up before Release Deadline!  Off to work now!  Will post after:)**

Huge thanks to madmonkey on the Mini NES/SNES side; genderbent on the Mini PSC side, for their fantastic efforts in helping get RetroArch Xtreme in tip top shape!  1.7.7 is now "canon" and is a great deal better for us on all 3 Platforms, than previous RetroArchs have been, due to some of the incredible new additions!

There is a nifty, very cool widget feature, which you will see pop up various Notifications as you do different things.  I would highly recommend leaving this enabled, as if myself or anyone else needs to help troubleshoot, having it on will be quite helpful.  Not to mention, it will indicate success with Playlists, Controllers being recognized, and a multitude of other things!

Ozone will be default for the NESC/SNESC, since we have the Main UI for the primary aesthetically pleasing scenario, relating to Artwork for games, and so on!  Most of us on the NES/SNES use the Main UI a majority of the time!  But, if you decide you would rather use XMB, instead, simply go into RetroArch Settings, Drivers, Menu, change Ozone to XMB, then exit RetroArch.  Rinse and repeat to do go back to Ozone.  Feel free to transform anytime, doing the expected "Transformers'" sound effect!

XMB will be default for the PSC, since the Main UI is still not quite there, as far as anything but default PCSX ReArmed PS1 Games.  This "will" change in the future, of course!  But, it will take some time to be at the level of optimal use that we have already become accustomed to with the NES/SNES!  You can, of course, switch from XMB to Ozone, the exact same way as I detailed above for NESC/SNESC!  

Lastly, I have done quite a few additional tweaks to try to get every last bit of performance and speed out of this latest Update.  Things should be nice and breezy and snappy, as far as Menu Navigation, loading of Games/Cores, and so on!  And, don't forget, you can install the additional Add-On from the Release or KMFD Mod Hub,  _km_retroarch_xtreme_playlist_database.hmod  This will allow you to Import, Scan Files or Directories to add to Preset Playlists based on what is detailed within the Databases.  If you find something that isn't recognized, it simply is not in the Database.  But, once you load it, and it is in History, you can "still" add it to your "favorites!"  So, that is a nice quick workaround.  You can manually do your own playlists.  But, it will take just a little extra effort.

**RetroArch Xtreme Redundancies Cleaned up for Mini NES/SNES/PSC!**

With this Release, I have cleaned up redundant paths that really should never have been used for the Mini NES/SNES/PSC to begin with.  The entire .config/retroarch path is now gone on NES/SNES; and .config/retroarch gone on PSC.  Do not worry, as far as maintaining any current configurations, as when you install RetroArch 1.7.7 Xtreme for NES/SNES, it will automatically "push" (Thanks DanTheMan827!) anything from .config/retroarch to main directory!  PSC Users, simply move anything from .config that you want to keep, to retroarch Main.

**Optimal _DUMMY Folder Usage for Mini NES/SNES!**

This is one of the most consistently asked questions I get on a day to day basis.  How do you do the _DUMMY Folder?  I have showcased it in many many videos, as it is my main means of transportation on the Mini Classics.  With this Update, and RetroArch Xtreme 1.7.7 installed, the only prerequisite is that you are on USB-HOST.  If that is the case, simply make a folder, which you can name _DUMMY if you wish, or Games, whatever.  I just happen to use _DUMMY in my case, and it is more referential, as some of the other things that have been coined within the concurrent Core Set Releases.  Make this folder "outside" of the hakchi directory!  This is very important.  If you do not do this, when you "export", the _DUMMY folder will be deleted.  As long as it is outside the hakchi directory, on your flash/hard drive, it will remain intact on an export.  

**OpenBOR, Finally!  Full Speed Ahead For Mini NES/SNES!**

I would have to say that this is one of the most oft requested things to be for the Mini NES/SNES!  I am very happy to finally bring this to you all to play around with!  I give mad props to Senile Team, for the original OpenBOR (Beats of Rage) Madmonkey for the Execution on Mini NES/SNES, bslenul for the Main UI (User Interface) Integration.  We definitely don't want to have to Command Line these games, such as madmonkey, bslenul, and myself initially did for "testing".  I handled the performance and optimization aspect of the OpenBOR scenario.  

The OpenBOR Core is in "Special" Tab, along with "DraStic".  Simply install the Core, add a .pak, and command line should be:

/bin/openbor

You should be able to run a majority of games from 2004-2014, roughly.  Some of the newer ones, such as GI Joe: Attack on Cobra Island, will not work...for the moment.  He-Man: Masters of the Universe, however, one of the pinnacle achievements of OpenBOR, however, does...in fact, work!  It is a tremendously cool game that really captures the essence of the original cartoon series!  You can see me test drive this baby in a video below the Release Notes!  Games that do not work may seem like they will load, then crash before the start of the game.

**OpenBOR, Pseudo Full Speed Ahead for Mini PSC!**

Unfortunately, this time around, PSC Users won't get the same, truly excellent OpenBOR experience as NES/SNES Users...at least for now!  This may change in the future.  But, you can "still" run OpenBOR with two Updated Cores within this Release.  Refer to the PS CLASSIC/OpenBOR Folder for the Templates for each, as well as a ReadMe!  

You have 2 current options to run OpenBOR games.  A 3rd Option will likely make it to PSC, in the future.  For 
now, it is more optimal for usage on the NESC/SNESC.

If you load a game and it emits an error message or crashes, it is very likely not supported.

DOS (Full Speed), which equates to games that were made around 2004.  These games will run full speed ahead, with minor hiccups due to slight timing offsets.  These are mostly negligible.  Simply copy a Pak file into OpenBOR_DOS Template Folder (Yes, the folder can be renamed). The Pak file must be renamed, exactly as BOR.PAK or it will not work.

PSP (Slow to Moderate Speed), which relates to games from 2004 and on, til roughly the year 2011.  These games will vary in terms of performance and speed, some running better than others.  Halloween: Wrath of Michael Meyers is an example of one that runs pretty top notch.  Final Fight Gold CE is a little sluggish.  But, it is still quite playable!  Copy Pak into Paks folder.  This will not need renamed like the DOS one.  It will work, as is, as long as it is the only Pak in said folder.  If you attempt to put more than one in Paks folder, it will not auto load.  It will, instead, do a menu prompt.  Then, you'd have to choose the pak.  Personally, I do one game per template, as I much prefer the auto load method!

OpenBOR_DOS

Run OpenBOR_DOS, bor.exe, with DOSBox-SVN, BOR.PAK, if it exists and is supported, will auto load.

OpenBOR_PSP  

Run OpenBOR_PSP, EBOOT.PBP, with PPSSPP Xtreme, Pak file, if present in paks folder, will auto load.

Again, the 3rd, full speed ahead method, may work its way onto the PSC in the future!

**Of Course, I am throwing you a bone, with an OpenBOR Test Game:)**

I may add more in the future!  But, for now, you have Beats of Rage in KMFD Mod Hub, Games Tab, for NES/SNES Users, and in Xtras/Games/OpenBOR, for PSC Users.  Enjoy this fantastic game!

**DOSBox SVN Sound Initialization fixed up!**

DOSBox SVN is better, speed and performance wise, on the Mini NES/SNES/PSC, for more cpu/gpu intensive games, than Standard DOSBox is.  But, there was one little, pesky bug, which hindered the overall enjoyment, to a degree.  The sound card did not properly initialize.  With this Update, it will, and you will get Full Sound Ahead!  Why did this specifically need to be done for This Update!:)?  Well...

**Who loves incredible SHMUPS!?  Introducing Tyrian!**

Special thanks to IncendiaryIdea for bringing this SHMUP'Tastic game to my attention.  This will run with the Updated DOSBox SVN Core!  It had a few bugs in its execution, which are now fixed up.  It is fully playable for This Release.  It is generally a gpu/cpu intensive game.  So, you will not get Full Speed Ahead.  But, you can lower the video settings in-game if you so choose to.  I was fine running it, as is, and thoroughly enjoyed it!  You can grab the game from KMFD Mod Hub, Games Tab (For Mini NES/SNES), as well as Xtras/Games/DOS (For Mini NES/SNES/PSC!  Personal thanks to Beylie, as well, whom helped with one fix for the "mouse" bug.  The ship would effectively try to move by itself.  I have it working, in its current incarnation, without any "mouse" issues.  But, I still have included the "fix", just in case anyone does so happen to need it.  It is in Xtras/DOS, and is called tyrian.conf.  Depending on set-up, you may also need or want to rename the .conf  You would need to add is as an uncompressed game, via hakchi, and amend the path within the file to point to your current directory.  It works much like the uae files do for Amiga consumption!

In any case, you should not need the fix.  It is there, just in case!  Controls for Tyrian can easily be set up by going into Controls, changing to keyboard+mouse, backing out, backing in, then setting them up as follows:

DOSBOX Tyrian:

ctrl-backspace -- kill OpenTyrian
alt-enter      -- fullscreen
ctrl-f10       -- ungrab mouse
arrow keys     -- ship movement
space          -- fire weapons
enter          -- toggle rear weapon mode
ctrl/alt       -- fire left/right sidekick

These controls are in a ReadMe, inside Xtras/Mapping.  If any of you have any difficulty mapping, let me know!  I plan on working in some defaults, probably for the Next Update, to help with DOSBox, MSX (Metal Gear), and so on!  This will be so you simply load the game and play, without any additional configuration!  This will be on the To Do list for the very Next Update!

Thanks again for the recommendation IncendiaryIdea!  Due to the nature of a few things needing fixed up, just to get it properly going...in addition to "reality", I was a little delayed:)  Hope you get to enjoy it, this weekend!   Thanks so much for the patience!

**PCSX ReArmed NEON Xtreme now has CHD Support!**

This is something we have all wanted for a considerable amount of time!  CHD will ONLY work with the PCSX ReArmed Xtreme Variants.  I will go more into detail about those in the next Note Section.  Personal thanks to aliaspider, retro-wertz, hizzlekizzle, and the rest of the PCSX Libretro Team, as well as anyone who has ever taken on the challenge of CHD Support for PCSX!  

You can use the CHDMAN in Xtras/Tools/PS1 to easily convert bin+cue/iso to .chd!  Yes, .chd does have better compression, overall, than eboots (.pbp).  But, if you are comfortable with eboots, as they stand...don't worry all too much about going out of your way to get everything into .chd format!  The games will not run any better!  This is, more or less, a bonus for those who are more limited on space, especially NAND users!  You could, additionally, if non-USB-HOST, use the provided tools in PS1 folder, and rip out the music, videos, compress the resulting files to CHD, and easily run a great many games strictly on NAND, if you so wanted to!  I have done a multitude of videos regarding this in the NESC days, when USB-HOST did not yet exist!  You can refer to my YouTube Video Ripping Tutorials, or ask me.  I may do a newer ripping video, as well!

**PCSX ReArmed goes even More Xtreme!**

As if we couldn't get anymore Xtreme!  This time, we are playing around with video plug-ins and other various changes, that will supplement your overall experience on a case by case scenario.  Personal thanks to Genderbent and anyone else who had suggested this be looked into!  And, great thanks to Madmonkey for helping with the differentials between Plug-Ins!  With PCSX ReArmed NEON Xtreme installed, you will now be able to use the following command line perimeters when on NES/SNES:

_km_pcsx_rearmed_neon

  - /bin/pcsx  <clover_args> (triggers Xtreme NEON Mode Activate!
  - /bin/pcsx-peops  <clover_args> (triggers Xtreme PEOPS Mode Activate!
  - /bin/pcsx-standard  <clover_args> (triggers Standard Mode Activate!
  - /bin/pcsx-unai  <clover_args> (triggers Xtreme UNAI Mode Activate!

Each of these variants have a distinctive difference!  I will be showcasing some of these in videos, for sure!  Some of the differences might surprise you.  But, you will have a nominal performance and speed gain, depending on which game and which variant!  If in doubt, use /bin/pcsx or /bin/pcsx-standard  If you want to get to new potential heights, go for it, and try out /bin/pcsx-peops and/or /bin/pcsx-unai  Some personal test results are as follows:

Xtreme NEON is best, overall, for compatibility, performance, speed.

Xtreme PEOPS should clean up some graphical glitches, such as the cut scenes in Metal Gear Solid.  Additionally, in testing, PEOPS allowed me to run even more games in High Definition Mode Activate!

Xtreme UNAI ran fine, albeit with some minor graphical glitches.

All 3 of the above have CHD Support, and can handle games such as Parasite Eve 2, Diablo, NBA Lives, etc, on top of some other previously non-working titles.  I also got varying FPS results with/without HD Mode Activated.

Standard is the most stable experience for those who do not want to muck about!

I look forward to any and all responses as far as which variants work best with which games!

**NEW Sega Game Gear/Master System Core!**

I took this into consideration, being that we do not have much in the way of Game Gear Support.  It was a misnomer that PicoDrive supported GG games, for many.  It does not, whatsoever, run GG games.  I fixed the ReadMe to reflect this.  It was a remnant from the very first PicoDrive we put together 2+ years ago, when GG was a typo.  But, like the great Gearboy Core, which has very accurate GB/GBC emulation, Gearsystem is equally great for Sega Game Gear/Master System Games.  The bonus perk is that you can do custom borders for more than one GG Core, for those of you who are trying to keep one set of borders for Genesis Games, on say PicoDrive, and so on!  Thanks to Ignacio Sanchez AKA drhelius, for his tremendous work on Gearboy and Gearsystem!  Note, in Xtras/PERM-CHEATS-PATCHING, is an incredible patch to make Metroid 2: Samus Returns look almost spot on and indistinguishable from an NES game!

**Introducing QUASI88, an PC-8801 Core!**

This one makes me quite happy, and is capable of running some truly and uniquely interesting games, as you will see in my video demonstration below!  Several of these games were on both Sharp1 and PC-88 Computers.  This particular Core emulates PC-88!  BIOS are accounted for in the Xtras/BIOS section.  Thanks for the assist on this, Madmonkey!  And, thank you, Showzoh Fukunaga, for your work on the Emulator!  And, finally, thank you celerizer and anyone else on the libretro side, working on this really cool Core!  Note: this is in the lineage of NEC computers, such as PC-98, which runs the incredible Castlevani'esque game, Rusty! 

**By the way, QUASI88 supports the obscure Super Mario Bros. Special!**

There are some "Nintendo" games on PC-88 which are quite entertaining to behold.  Super Mario Bros. Special, Mario Bros. Special, Punch Ball Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong 3: Dai Gyakushuu, some of which will be covered in my video!  Due to hardware limitations, at the time, some caveats, sacrifice wise, had to be made.  Be sure to check out the video!

**EasyRPG Updated!**

This incredible game engine is capable of running RPG Maker 2000/2003 Games!  I give personal thanks to AriaOnThePlanetes and NichoMania2 for helping test and confirm some changes.  Most originating English Games work great.  Some translations might turn up encoding errors, which may be fixed in a future Update, once command line perimeters and whichever dependencies are accounted for.

Add the .ldb as a game, uncompressed.  Then, copy the rest of the pertinent files into the same folder.  Do not use the .ini as a game loader, despite it previously working as such.  PSC Users, simply use the entire folder, as a game!  Ghabry, thanks for your dedication to this project, as well as any people who have ever worked on RPG Maker!  

**Game & Watch Updated!**

Thank you, leiradel, for helping fix up two great games, that had always crashed before...dkong and dkong2!  This great Core is even better now!

Thank you all for being patient and supportive, in the meantime!

**Final Notes!**

I had been asked consistently about when I would get the Update, and did my absolute best to get it out on 5-18, as I tentatively stated it to be.  Some things made it into the Update, which I have not covered in the Release Notes.  They will show up in videos, or you may discover them on your own...in this Open World Modding Adventure!  Enjoy the Update!  See you all again, soon!

Sincerely, KMFDManic!

**5-14-19**

For those of you checking here for the Next Release, OpenBOR, etc, it will be posted on 5-18-19, along with some other incredible goodies, per usual!  It will coincide with this weekend's Release of the inevitably awesome Keanu Reeves movie, John Wick 3!  If you had not seen parts 1 or 2 yet, better get to it!And, of course, refer to my YouTube Channel linked to way above, to see OpenBOR demonstrations and some Drumming, in preparation for yet another amazing Update!  See you on 5-18-19!

**4-29-19**

For those who have seen Avengers: Endgame, I hope it lived up to your expectations!  It was an epic and fantastic movie!  And, I found it incredibly funny to run into an anachronism within the 2nd episode of current season of Game of Thrones...Someone's Cell Phone inexplicably went off!  Now then:

**SD Prep Updated!**

Thanks DanTheMan827!  This Update changes a couple things:

It clears the boot0 and uboot from the sd card and it starts the partition 128MB into the card to allow for the possibility of upgrading to a bootable card without reformatting in the future.

**RetroArch Xtreme Updated, Spruced Up, & Optimized to 1.7.6!**

Rocking the Mini SNES/NES like it's a "Boss" Switch:)

We held off on this one for a little while, until the time when things would benefit the Mini NES/SNES!  Enjoy the vastly spruced up RetroArch Ozone Interface.  Huge personal thanks to Madmonkey (for helping with the seemingly impossible to run interface for our hardware!) and Natinusala (great individual behind Ozone!)

**Note: I will shave off a few MB from both 1.7.5 and 1.7.6 RetroArchs for the Next Update:)**

**RetroArch Xtreme Updated with very optimal Playlist Support!**

This has oft been requested.  But, it was never high priority, simply due to the massive amount of space that "Playlist Databases" required, NAND internal flash memory wise.  This is no longer a problem, as DanTheMan827 and Madmonkey have graciously helped crush these things down to a very nice 75 percent smaller size.  I optimized things as much as possible to further cut the size down.  Initially, last year, when I first added the databases, they were around 80 MB, installed!  This is a travesty and pretty unacceptable for normal NAND usage.  You can easily see why it wasn't something that was high priority, as far as Playlist incorporation as a standard.

But, now, with this Update, they are at a much more optimal and beautiful 29 MB install size!  Install the HMOD, _km_retroarch_xtreme_playlist_database.hmod, in order to enjoy and benefit from Playlist Support!  You can refer to the video below to see them in action, and how much of a convenience they are as far as setting up personalized, easy to access Playlists via RetroArch!

**Who Loves Metal Gear!?**

Last time, it was all about Zelda and the Ancient Stone Tablets!  Many of you have already 100 percented the weeks 1-4, since then!  Again, personal thanks to BsLeNuL and Madmonkey for their roles in this fantastic addition, as well as anyone who had worked on the original game/s, as well as the translation, hacking, and updating of Ancient Stone Tablets!  

This time around, we are going to get into the "Real" Metal Gear 1 and 2!  These were on the MSX/MSX2 Computer in Japan.  The 1st Metal Gear, which most are familiar with, from the NES days...is vastly different than the MSX/MSX2 ones, Metal Gear was a 3 month rush job, and intentionally made to be as different as its MSX/MSX2 counterpart as possible.  Hideo Kojima, the mastermind behind these two, was very disappointed with Metal Gear 1 and Snake's Revenge on NES...both of which he had absolutely nothing to do with.  They went against his original vision, which you can see within 1 and 2 on MSX/MSX2!  

Suffice to say, I grew up on the NES ones, and really enjoyed them.  I have beaten the 1st one countless times. 
 But, when I finally had a chance to play the "real" ones, I truly saw a whole different perspective to things.  These were made available "officially" in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for PS2, and PS3, Vita, and 360, amongst a couple other platforms.  

In any case, you can also run Metal Gear 1 and 2 with the fMSX and BlueMSX Cores, respectively.  What makes this particular Update so special is the ability to now "Save" both of these games, as well as other MSX/MSX2 with BlueMSX.  Suspend States now work!  I give huge thanks to antorsae for his part in this phenomenal addition!  Simply install the latest RetroArch Xtreme of your choice, and BlueMSX, and you are good to go!  

Playstation Classic Users, you are also in luck...You can now update the Injector, and have RetroArch Save Support for MSX/MSX2, as well!

On a side note, when the NES Classic first came out, neither fMSX or BlueMSX were optimal for playing games, due to lack of truly optimal controls.  I have mentioned this a few times before.  But, fr500 (integration into Cores/RetroArch for keyboard to controller mapping!) and R-Type (initial generic mapper!) were both gracious and considerate enough to help out with this cause.  I am glad this turned out as well as it did, as keyboard to controller mapping has proven to be one of the absolute best additions.  And, it affects a good dozen Cores, such as fMSX, BlueMSX, DOSBox, and other such PC related Cores.

Aside from the video below Release Notes, you can also refer to Xtras/Mapping, to get the appropriate button mappings for these games, as well as others.

BIOS are needed, and detailed in Master BIOS Module, while viewed in Hakchi. Or, you can see them in Xtras/BIOS.

**Who Loves ColecoVision!?**

Most know of Atari 2600.  Not as many are aware of ColecoVision.  But, it was a great system, at the time, which went up against Atari 2600, Intellivision, and so on.  Many ColecoVision Versions run circles around their 2600 counterparts...I am talking about "you", Donkey Kong!  That is just one of many prime examples.  

Along with the great "Save" ability with suspend states, for BlueMSX, also comes "Save" ability for ColecoVision games!

Playstation Classic Users, yet again...you are in luck..The updated Injector will allow RetroArch Save Support for ColecoVision with BlueMSX!

There is also a several second load time alotted when running any ColecoVision game.  You can run modified BIOS to "skip" this unnecessary load time, and pretty much instantly start any game!  This is displayed in a video below.  And, I will do my best to help those of you interested in ColecoVision, and cutting down the load times, know how to modify the BIOS so that this benefit can be part of your Mini Experience, as a whole!  We've all certainly had our fair share of load times in our gaming experience.  And, like MSX, covered in the Metal Gear Notes above, BIOS are absolutely mandatory for ColecoVision usage.  These are noted in Xtras/BIOS, too.

 I am talking about you Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen!  Ironically, the PC version has "zero load times".  It is more fluid like the original Legend of Zelda on NES...with instant screen changes!  PS1 version was simply awful with its excessive load times.

**Who Has Had Trouble Running Metal Gear (MSX) and ColecoVision!?**

MSX/ColecoVision have been problematic for many to run over the years.  There is a new HMOD to account for BIOS, _km_retroarch_bluemsx_bios.hmod  Install it along with the Updated BlueMSX Core, and you will be able to run, not only MSX/MSX2 Roms...but, also ColecoVision!  Command line is /bin/bluemsx  Personal thanks to BouKiCHi for rewriting the BIOS in such a way that they could legally be used with the Xtreme Core Set!  Don't worry, PSC Users, these BIOS will install with the Injector!  I truly hopes this helps make things easier!  This leave Artwork:

**Who Loves MSX/ColecoVision 3d Box Art!?**

Many of you who have followed my videos have consistently seen me use 3d Box Art for a majority of games that I showcase.  With this amazing MSX/ColecoVision oriented Update, definitely check out the "alternate" Mega Link, specifically, Xtras/Game Art, for amazing MSX/ColecoVision 3d Box Art, courtesy of WallyWonka (Coleco) and 2speed (Microsoft MSX)!  Enjoy!

P.S., there is an MSX, as well as ColecoVision Cheats HMOD, as well:)  

**Who Loves Capcom? Who Loves Arcade Games!? PX68k Core Updated!**

Many of you might not be aware that the Sharp X68000 Computer was used in the development of multiple Arcade Games!  Capcom is one of several companies to utilize the tools X68000 had to offer.  Games such as Final Fight, Ghouls N'Ghosts, Street Fighter II: Champion Edition, and so on, were remarkably close to their Arcade counterparts, as a result.  This is yet another Core that has been somewhat tricky to get up and running, due to needing BIOS.  And, it also had one slightly irritating flaw, slow menu navigation (accessed with L2; Controller can be mapped so L2=L1, if on SNES or lesser Controllers, temporarily).

Neither of these issues are longer a problem, as with this Update, they are both accounted for!  You can grab and install _km_retroarch_bios_px68k.hmod, along with the Updated PX68k Core, to be covered on both front!  Personal thanks to retro-wertz for helping with faster in Core Menu browsing, R-Type for the amazing libretro Port...and, of course, Sharp for being so incredible to make the BIOS legal to share with the Xtreme Core Set!  Ironically, the last TV (Sharp Aquos) I bought was one of the last models before the Sharp TVs (I believe) were changed over to a different manufacturer!  I have always personally bought Sony Bravia and Sharp Aquos TVs, as long as I have had LCD/LED.  They also share many of the same parts.  I hope both continue to thrive in the future!

**Who Loves SHMUPS!?**

Many of you have consistently seen me play SHMUPS in multiple videos, as well as getting fixed up ones in various Releases.  This time around, another incredible SHMUP, Batsugan, made by Toaplan...which also happens to be on Sega Saturn, now has partial (not full, as of yet, unfortunately) and fixed graphics.  You can run this on the Updated MAME 2003 Plus!  Personal thanks to Arcadez for this great addition!  This will run on later MAME/FBA Cores, without full on graphic/sound issues.  But, for me, personally...anytime a Legacy Core works in encryption support fixes, it is a milestone!  So, take it as you will!  Not to mention, performance and speed is generally better on the less accurate Legacy Cores (MAME 2003 Xtreme, Plus, 2000, etc)!

**Dreamcast Revised and Optimized!**

You will now have three tiers to play around with for Dreamcast (Reicast).  One, Reicast Accuracy, which is the most current coding, and runs with /bin/reicast-accuracy  It contains the latest additions, and offers the best overall compatibility!.  But, performance can take a slight drop due to its increased accuracy.  Two, Reicast Xtreme, which runs with /bin/reicast , and is a median between Accuracy and Performance.  It has the best of both worlds, and is quite solid for most Users.  Lastly, Reicast Performance, which runs with the command line, /bin/reicast-performance and, sacrifices some Accuracy and Compatibility to have better Performance!  This should give you a good edge on finding the best path for any given game you so choose to run!  Thanks to Autechre and FlyingHead for their continued support with this fantastic Core, the original Authors on PC, as well as madmonkey for helping on our end!

**Nintendo 64 also Optimized for a Performance Upgrade!**

I mentioned before that I had hoped to get Killer Instinct running 50-60 FPS.  Unfortunately, while I was able to gain some FPS for the game, it will likely not have a very good chance at going a true and steady 50-60 FPS, all around.  The hardware specs required to do this are simply not powerful enough on the Mini NES/SNES/PSC!  Your "best" chance at running this game somewhat reasonably is with Glupen, /bin/glupen  Do not expect miracles.  Several stages have a bit of FPS droppage.  And, unfortunately, the Arcade Versions of 1/2, will "Never" run well on any of these 3 Minis, and also unlikely to on the Genesis Mini.  So, what it comes down to is mainly the SNES Version, which runs quite nicely on SNES9x 2005+ in particular.  Command Line is /bin/snes05-plus

That being said, ParallelN64 Core has a Performance Upgrade, with up to 15-20 FPS gains on several games.  It won't run as well with Performance as say Glupen.  But, overall compatibility is excellent on many games, due to the different video/audio plugins that are used.  I would suggest going through the 3 primary N64 Cores, in exact order, to find which suits any given game the best for you!  These would be:

- /bin/glupen with _km_glupen64.hmod

- /bin/mupen with _km_mupen64plus.hmod

- /bin/parallel with _km_parallel_n64.hmod

There is still a decent chance some more can be done with Mupen and Parallel.  But, Glupen is likely to remain static, for now, and as Legacy as possible.  Thanks to all authors and developers of these Cores, as well as the great help of Madmonkey, per usual!  Also, thanks BsLeNuL, for helping with crucial Parallel testing, that made the optimizations more viable.

**PicoDrive fixed up with overscan fixes and better 32X compatibility!**

Overscan has always been an issue with the PicoDrive Core.  Thanks to the help of jdgleaver, things are now fixed up!  And, thanks to Jul Car for the heads up on a few 32X games not working.  They are fixed, now!

**PCSX ReArmed NEON Touch Ups!**

Thanks for the heads up, bolton80.  Graphical Glitches fixed for a few games, and timing changed to be more appropriate for performance and speed with the Xtreme Variant.  

**HMOD/Core Install Sizes Accounted For!**

Several Releases back, Madmonkey helped with Core Compression so that Cores (Emulator ones, particularly) installed at 75 percent smaller.  This has been a true godsend as far as maintaining precious NAND space.  But, some of the non-emulator HMODs, such as the MESS Dependencies, Cheats, Playlists, did not benefit from this change.  These will slowly but surely be accounted for, and crushed down to 75, give or take, percent smaller sizes, as well...in future Releases!  

The primary three that will be tested out, but not make this release, are to be MESS 2016 Dependencies, Cheats, and Playlists as the first to be taken down several notches to far more reasonable install sizes.  Again, thanks to DanTheMan827 and Madmonkey for their help on this!  IE: The final end results are tentatively to be at:

- MESS 2016 Dependencies, from 83.4 MB down to 11.7 MB  
- Master Cheats, all combined into one HMOD...from 49 MB down to 3.82 MB
- Database (Playlists), from 29 MB down to 7.88 MB

Again, this is another Experimental Change that will need tested thoroughly before implementing things into the Core Set Release.  But, it is, in fact WIP...So, it might make it out "Next" Release!  

Keep in mind, MESS 2016 Dependencies, for now...can be weened down to a smaller size, simply by backing up the HMOD, then deleting Dependencies you don't plan on using for MESS, from the root hash folder.

Not only that, nearly EVERY Core/HMOD (in THIS Update) will now show the install size, whilst viewed in Hakchi2 CE.  Just refer to the window to the right, while any of them is highlighted, to see the "Install Size".  This will make it much easier to manage, as far as what can safely be installed.  "Knowing is half the battle!", once said a "wise" cartoon:)

This also means, if you utilize the Hakchi2 CE option to generate modules report, from Modules Tab, you can get a nice listing of how much MB is being used, overall.  Remember, SNES Classic Internal NAND Flash Memory, safe estimate for usage, is roughly 200 MB, give or take...And, NES Classic, safe number, is around 300 MB, give or take.  You can go somewhat above these numbers.  But, don't go too far, or you can break Cores/Save Ability.

**Playstation Classic Users, Injectors Updated!**

I will still be doing "Another" Update, specifically for PS Classic, by the weekend.  But, for now, you will have the Updated Cores/fixes/changes that NESC/SNESC has, as well as separate Injectors for the Cores/Cheats.  Cheats can take up to 10-15 minutes to install!  So, for those who do not necessarily need them, they are in their own Injector, for optional use.  Simply confirm overwrite, when installing any of the Injectors.  But, keep in mind, AutoBleem should be installed before using any other Injector, to avoid any conflicts.  The BleemSync Injectors will post on the alternative Mega Link sometime tomorrow!

RetroBoot Users, I will pass along the pertinent Updates/Changes, so that genderbent can get them out to those of you who use that fantastic Modification, as well!

Hello Everyone!  Anything new and interesting?:)  As per usual, Bullet Points, Release Notes, Videos, Closing Statement!

**As far as the drama that some of you have seen unfold.  Some of my statements regarding it are purely objective and forward moving.  We have detailed chat logs from day one of our (Nintendo/Sega/Sony Classics Discord), til now, which clearly detail our every single step in the Scene...the good days (when we find success with PSP, Dreamcast, DS, USB-HOST, and so on), the bad days (when people argue), the ugly days (when people troll or stir trouble), and so on.  It has always been a wonderful ride, all the way...and, quite the journey!**

**First of all, should I buy a Sega Genesis Mini!?**

This is quite the loaded question!  I was hoping to have time to put together a video before Release.  But, it will post after!  It will go over my personal experience with Sega, a few interesting tidbits relating to their past endeavors with Games/Consoles, as well as a few other surprises.  But, as far as I am concerned, it is worth the purchase for me.  80 USD may seem a little steep for some, Mod or Non-Mod, wise.  But, you have to remember just how much the original Console even cost, along with each additional game.  You could easily have put out 2500 USD for all the content that will be on the Mini Genesis, along with the main Console...back in the day!  

Yes, the Sony was considered a bust and failure for the general public, unfortunately.  That definitely put a crimp in the future of the Mini Classics.  But, the Genesis Mini may have a solid chance of turning things around.  Hopefully, it will change things to the point of Nintendo regaining interest, and there being a Nintendo 64 Mini!  But, that is fairly unlikely at this point!  One could only hope!

In any case, I will get a Genesis Mini video up, likely tomorrow!  I didn't want to delay this Update any longer!  I will get several other videos up throughout the week, as well!  So, stay tuned to my YouTube channel!

**Join us on Discord!**

You can have great and direct Support for Hakchi, Cores, and many other things...as well as just get involved in some day to day conversations with others in the Scene!  Discord works great via Mobile Phone, as well as from PC!  Join Madmonkey, DanTheMan827, DarkAkuma, myself, and several more!  DarkAkuma, by the way...just did a great update for the Sfrom Tool!  Follow the permanent link at top to get to it!  I will do more on Sfroms in the near future.  There are simply many great perks to them, for purists...as far as the default SNES Classic Emulator Canoe is concerned, such as really great lag latency and better running FX/FX2 Games on the lower spec NESC/SNESC hardware!

**Putting My Foot Down, so to speak!**

Life imitates Art imitates Life.  We have had our own Mod of Thrones/Game of Mods.  But, suffice to say, things will be quite progressively positive minded, in the future, for all involved!

This is a very objective and positively forward moving and thinking statement.  For those of you who are initiated or not, rest assured, no matter the case...There are many great people in the "Scene" who will continue to push out magnificent and super awesome magic for all of you to enjoy on a regular basis!  Do not, at all, be overly concerned about any given state of affairs.  Drama can be a part of any "Scene."  But, regardless, the End User experience will continue to exponentially grow over time!  From my standpoint, I will continue remaining polite and courteous, doing my best to ensure you all keep enjoying the pure magic and nostalgia of the Mini Classics!

Playstation Classic will soon have OTG Support, better Sega Saturn is still a decent possibility, the list goes on!  So many countless possibilities of things to come.  Not to mention, the Genesis Mini will be out later this year!  

Where does the "Putting My Foot Down" part come into play?  Well, let's keep things very simple.  When I joined the Mini Scene in 2016, I had one main goal...to do my best to offer up many endless possibilities and options to the End User, and help as many people enjoy their Minis as possible.  Choices are great...Pepsi and Coke, Macs and Windows, Iphone and Samsung, and so on!  There have been misguided intentions, to the tune of, "There Can Only Be One", Highlander style.  This is completely unacceptable.  I love the idea of multiple options.  FCEUMM, Nestopia, QuickNES, Mesen, and so on...versus "just one".  Same holds true for PS Classic, and AutoBleem, BleemSync, RetroBoot, PSpwned!  Ideally, coexistence, and supplementing one another! 

Some have made vain attempts to take down some of the aforementioned, in the past, as well as similarly minded scenarios in "other" Scenes, over the years.  A few have even given me a hard time, trying to get me and others to sacrifice the integrity of my/their creative freedom.  Imagine if you were playing with Legos, and someone told you that you could ONLY build one exact, preset thing with them?  This exact same scenario once befell the precious MAME scene, of which is one thing that would have been a truly sad thing to ever see fall on its head!  MAME is practically the reason I got into this stuff to begin with!

Suffice to say, I rarely step out of line, and do my best to always be nice with others I deal with on a regular basis, in my hobbyist platforms, as well as in reality, work, and social situations.  I don't go around "trolling" or "belittling" others, nor will I ever.  I will keep being me, and doing what I can to put many smiles on many faces, being happy in the fact that I have helped another, and another...better enjoy their Mini Experience!  

I collaborate with many amazing and great people.  I have made a lot of fantastic friends in these endeavors.  It has all been truly fulfilling.  So, again, coexisting is the name of the game here!  Let's keep things going!  Who knows, maybe Nintendo will come around.  And, we might end up getting that elusive Nintendo 64 Mini!

**Why was the Mod Store removed?**

There were many factors involved with its removal.  It isn't permanently gone, whatsoever.  It is just going to simply be re-added with the special Repo Support DanTheMan827/Madmonkey implemented.  The process of which is needed to do this was passed along, collaboratively with CompCom and ViralDNA, who are now actively working on the readding, as I type this.  Hakchi is still quite actively being worked upon.  The idea was to minimize accountability and responsibility on "what" is added into Hakchi.  The Mod Store is an addition that is not directly controlled by any member of Team Shinkansen, whom work on Hakchi.  Issues turning up related to the Mod Store download conflicts, 404 errors, not being actively updated, and so on, have nothing to do with Hakchi.  And, having to contend with Mod Store issues, when Hakchi Team Members have no ability to personally fix them, was counter productive to Hakchi Development.  So, the Manual Repo addition was the best course of action, to eliminate liability for what cannot be controlled.  And, With the Repo readdition, issues can properly be directed to those who specifically add each new Repo.  They would offer exact links so that one could do support questions, etc!  Hakchi2 CE Github most certainly has enough support issues, as it stands!  We are constantly sifting through them, trying to clean things up...and, get people back in action!

I have personally offered to help CompCom with anything necessary, related to the Mod Store.  

**Who really works on Hakchi?**

This is a fairly tricky and complicated question.  Many ask this on quite a regular basis.  So, to clear things up...Hakchi started out with Madmonkey, then progressed into Hakchi2, with Cluster and pcm720.  Cluster took a break due to personal reasons, and Team Shinkansen was formed branching Hakchi2 into Hakchi2 CE...which was a very nice collaboration between Skogaby, Princess Daphie, DanTheMan827, and Madmonkey.  These are the main people who have been working on Hakchi.  Some have mistakenly believed HakchiResources AKA ModMyClassic Teams have actively worked on Hakchi.  The latter mentioned have worked on their own endeavors, and have collaborated with Hakchi on a few various things.  But, there is no direct affiliation between the two.  And, I, myself...have also NOT directly worked on any Hakchi.  I merely contribute and collaborate in the way of Core and RetroArch optimal compatibility and performance (from my side), as well as helping test and troubleshoot things for them (on their side), so that things can be fixed up for the End User.  I have been doing this since the Cluster phase.  I have helped fix thousands of issues over the last 2 years.  TeamViewer was quite common for me, in the beginning, for sure!  In order to handle Cores and RetroArch, which I do work with...having a harmonious compatibility with Hakchi is most paramount.  So, I am quite active in helping, in that respect.

**Now then, Who Loves Zelda!?  How about Ancient Stone Tablets, Save Mode Activate!?**

**This change is for NESC/SNESC Users!  PSC Users simply need to copy and paste the cartridge.sram save from week 1 to week two, and so on, manually.  Get to a point in week one, shut down PSC, then transfer the save, and you're golden!**

Nintendo had an incredible peripheral that was never released in most Countries...The Satellaview!  Some truly amazing games were released for this, including some very nice Zelda games.  These have, over the years, undergone some drastic transformations as far as translations, hacks, MSU-1 inclusions, etc.  One of these games is BS Zelda: The Ancient Stone Tablets, which is comprised of 4 separate weeks, for the entire adventure!  Each week is contained within its own rom.  But, easily migrating a save from one week to the next has been a general problem over the years, for many.  Now, with this Release, you can very easily share saves between all 4 weeks!  I give tremendous and huge thanks to BsLeNuL and madmonkey for their part in this awesomeness!  You will need to install RetroArch 1.7.5 or 1.7.4 Xtreme for this to work.

In Xtras/MULTI-DISK, is a _Zelda_Ancient_Stone_Tablets_ReadMe! with a few specifics.  But, essentially, add the games via Hakchi.  Normal Rom Wise, can pretty much be added, as is.  But, MSU-1 wise, make sure to disable .Sfrom conversion and Game Compression when adding, via Hakchi Settings.  Once games are all added and accounted for, weeks 1-4, go to the Command Line perimeters and add at the tail end of the Argument, this:

--shared-save CLV-FOLDER-NAME-HERE

IE:

/bin/snes18 /var/games/CLV-U-CBDRA/bszelda_mq2.smc.7z

would become:

/bin/snes18 /var/games/CLV-U-CBDRA/bszelda_mq2.smc.7z --shared-save CLV-U-CBDRA

CLV-U-CBDRA is the CLV Folder that I have bszelda_mq1.smc.7z in.  So, week 2 is
now tethered, save wise, to week 1!  Do the same for weeks 3 and 4, tethering those
to week 1!  

NOTE: It is best to use SNES9x2018 AKA SNES9X, for best results, as far as compatibility
for BS-X and MSU-1 games, in general!

**Speaking of Multi-Disk and .m3u Support!  Dreamcast now has it!**

For more details on other Cores that support .m3u, refer to Xtras/MULTI-DISK/_Multi-Disk_ReadMe!  In the case of this amazing Dreamcast Addition, with personal thanks to Autechre and FlyingHead, you can now play many Multiple Disk Dreamcast games, with full Disk-Swapping support!  You will need to use Reicast Accuracy for this to work!  /bin/reicast-accuracy for Mini NES/SNES  Direct load for PSC.  I have some sample .m3u templates included that can be amended and modified to work with any of the supported .m3u Cores...which include, as of this Update:

- BlueMSX
- Cap32
- Hatari
- Mednafen Saturn
- PCSX ReArmed Neon
- PCSX1
- P-UAE
- PX68k
- Reicast
- ViceX64

**Also, for Dreamcast, D fixed!**

With Reicast Accuracy, D is now fully playable!  Thanks again Autechre and FlyingHead!

**Finally, for Dreamcast, a performance boost for Reicast Accuracy!**

You will get a nominal FPS gain for many games using Reicast Accuracy from this Release, compared to the last few!  Thanks madmonkey, Autechre, FlyingHead, for your continued efforts in helping with Dreamcast and its betterment on any and all platforms that are capable of supporting it!

**What about PS1 Multi-Disk?**

Again, for more details, Xtras/MULTI-DISK/_Multi-Disk_ReadMe!  There is also a video below!  One caveat to worry about for some games on Mini NES/SNES, involves a minor bug where Suspend States will not properly work, if an in-game memory card save does not exist.  So, be sure to create one, upon swapping Disks!  Personal thanks to Jul Car and BsLeNuL for their amazing interest in this entire process, as well as anyone who has ever worked on Multi Disk Swapping for ANY Core or Emulator in existence!  There are also some templates within Xtras/MULTI-DISK, to help get you going, .m3u wise.  This will be updated, more, in the future...And, hopefully, this and any other minor bugs related to Swapping, can be fully eliminated!  PSC Users can also use these templates!

**Playstation Classic RetroArch & Cores Updated for Injectors!  AutoBleem and BleemSync!**

Tremendous thanks to Genderbent for his phenomenal efforts with helping get RetroArch to a whole new level for PSC!  Things are running considerably better than in previous Releases!  All of the amazing Updates and bug fixes, changes, performance enhancements, and so on that made it to the NESC/SNESC this Update, are also set up for use on the PSC!  Enjoy better Dreamcast Accuracy Performance, amongst many other spectacular additions!  I have installers for both AutoBleem (which is now on autobleem-0.6.0-b2 (beta 2) Thanks screemer and the rest of the AutoBleem Team!) and BleemSync (this can be grabbed from the alternate link)!  As always, install AutoBleem or BleemSync Modifications, first, then the appropriate Injectors, allowing files to be overwritten.  Enjoy!

**NEO-GEO Mini Hacking & Modding back on track!**

Also, in the Nintendo/Sega/Sony Classics Discord, the NEO-GEO Mini is now being actively being worked upon.  Feel free to drop in and talk to the people who are working on it, such as Melthris, Old Man Rukus, and so on!

**Let's make a MESS of things, with Coleco Adam Computer support!**

**The cfg/hash for ADAM, so you can have controller and game support, is within Xtras/MESS**

This is for more advanced users.  And, I will gladly personally assist anyone who has difficulty with MESS.  Refer to the MESS_ReadMe! in Xtras/MESS for more details.  But, MESS is a Multi-Emulator Super System.  MESS 2016 Core works for Mini NES/SNES/PSC.  Dependencies to run it are in HMOD format for NES/SNES.  They are installed, by default, with PSC Injectors.  You will have to account for the BIOS, on your end, however.  Whatever the name of the games folder you run with, IE: coleco, would require the coleco.zip bios to be directly outside the folder, in order for the games to work.  I have done one Tutorial for Mini NES/SNES regarding MESS.  I will do more in the very near future to help everyone more easily run this on PSC, as well!  Huge thanks to Greenchili for his commendable and amazing collaborative efforts in helping bring one of my favorite childhood computers to fruition for the Mini Classics!  

ADAM is a very special thing to me, personally.  I, in fact, wanted a Commodore 64 for Christmas.  But, instead, I ended up getting a Coleco Adam Computer!  One big reason that computer failed was because it fully missed the Christmas Release deadline.  So, how did I get this for Christmas, when it wasn't out by Christmas!  Hindsight 20/20, all signs would point to it being a Clearance computer, getting to me the very next Christmas! 

Suffice to say, I absolutely loved the thing, for what I was able to do with it at the time.  A good school friend made several copies of Commodore 64 games for me, because I truly thought I would inevitably be getting one.  But, luckily, some of these games, such as Dragon's Lair...were also on ADAM:)  I had always wanted to replay that game.  And, CPC Amstrad and Commodore 64 Emulators were the closest approximation to that experience that I have had up til this point!  Now, myself and others can fully enjoy these great games, all over again...or, for the very first time!

The printer that came with the ADAM, which was touted one of the very first Family All-In-One Computers, having every peripheral you'd ever hope to need in one package...was used for some fun, as well.  I would do fake lunch menus, and replace the real ones at school, for a little prank, at the time.  The teachers and students actually got a huge kick out of it, and it became a weekly thing.  

There was also an amazing peripheral Coleco Add-On, which allowed me to run Atari 2600, as well as ColecoVision games.  I made great use of that. 

ADAM also came with a massive BASIC programming "novel", practically.  I went through the whole myriad of programs, including a Tron/Surround like one, which was fun to play around with.  And, one thing that really stood out were the Super Game Modules AKA Cassette Tapes, which have a few things different than any previous incarnations...These include (These will require special adding, to work, based on adam_flop.xml, in Xtras/MESS/hash):

**Patton!**

Patton, whom many of you also follow on YouTube, formally apologized to me (in a 15 minute long video, for that matter) for general mean-spiritedness that had been directed towards me out of a pass misunderstanding.  It takes guts to put yourself out there in front of thousands of people, and truly and genuinely and passionately say one is sorry.  It was a very heartfelt apology.  I graciously accepted it.  And, he was ecstatic that I did so.  You will likely see us commenting on one another's videos in playful fashion, in the future!  Thanks again, Patton!

P.S. Patton...Pssst!  Anytime someone leaves you a negative comment on your videos, or elsewhere...use that as humorous fodder for when you have blank cards that need filled in for Cards Against Humanity!!!  Negative people can be a veritable goldmine!  In all seriousness, now...moving on...to the Real Stuff!  Drama Be Gone!...

**RoadMap to the Xtreme Core Set!**

To make things less confusing, since we are not contending with not only the Nintendo Classics...but, also the Playstation Classic...I have separated things, so that once you go into the Release, you will now have:

- _km_NESC-SNESC = Nintendo Classics Core Set
- _km_PS CLASSIC = Playstation Classic Core Set
- _km_Xtras = Additional Tools and Xtras to help you with both Core Sets!

There will also be a RoadMap ReadMe!, that will help you know where to go in the Release, with a few tips, to boot!  Hope this makes things easier!

I have also archived prior 2017-2018 Release Notes into Xtras/Releases to clean things up.

**Nintendo DS DraStically better compatibility!  Mic Mode Activate!**

This is only for NESC/SNESC for now.  It is still WIP for the Playstation Classic, with Swingflip spearheading that side of things.  But, like with PS1 Games on PSC, which nearly all run quite nicely in HD...the same holds true for DS games on PSC with the Update!  If all goes well, that variant should be Released in the very near future!  

Initially, when we were working with the DraStic Nintendo DS Emulator last year, many popular games were found to not work.  We tried to ascertain whether it was a bug of the Emulator transition to the Mini, or another cause.  My best assumption, at the time, was that it was due to them being microphone oriented games.  Low and behold, this proved to be true.  These games tended to crash upon the "mic check".  But, no more, as they now work!  The overall and cumulative collaboration and efforts of Exophase, Xperia, madmonkey, DanTheMan827 (huge appreciation for helping on the Mini NES/SNES side of things!), and myself now brings forth this Updated Release, with microphone support!  Remember, this does not mean you will have full functionality or playability with "all" of the affected games...due to the obvious nature of there not truly being a presence of a microphone!  

Command Lines are:

- /bin/drastic <rom> <clover_args> Standard Mode
- /bin/drastic-mic <rom> <clover_args> Accuracy Mode  

**Note:** /bin/drastic will have better performance for most games.  It is best recommended to use
/bin/drastic-mic for games that would normally not work due to the failed mic check.  Additionally, HD resolution
will ONLY work well with Standard Mode.  Keep it off for Accuracy Mode.  General Mic Game compatibility list below Control Mapping Section.

**In-Game Saves should be compatible between Standard/Accuracy; Suspends not 100%**

  **Control Mapping**  
The Nintendo DS buttons are mapped 1:1 to the SNES controller.

The hinge can be "closed" by turning off the classic with the power switch or button (it won't shut down)

Classic controller in port 1
- Move the stylus with the left analog
- Press the stylus with ZL
- Toggle full-screen with ZR

Any controller in port 2
- Move the stylus with the d-pad
- Press the stylus with A
- Toggle fullscreen with start
- Swap screens with select
- Toggle horizontal/vertical screen arrangement with B

**Configuration Menu**  
You can access the drastic configuration menu by holding the reset button for more than 1 second.

Reset button would apply to down+select shortcut, home button, reset on console, itself!

**Mic Games include (Not all will be fully functional due to absence of a true microphone)**

**Games that require slash controls will also not necessarily be fully playable.  But, you can use
the Cheats to bypass some choke points, in this respect.**

**Speaking of Nintendo DS Cheats!**

Applies mainly to Mini NES/SNES, for the moment.  I previously released 2 hmods, to account for Standard/Xtreme Cheats, which were 13.1/36 MB install sizes.  DeadSkullzJr and nl255 were quite helpful in the Cheats respect.  This time around, Cheats will automatically install with the DraStic HMOD.  So, there is no further need for the aforementioned Cheat HMODs for DraStic.  Not only that, thanks to the great help of DanTheMan827, the install size is greatly reduced!  This goes a long way towards maintaining that precious internal NAND flash memory!

**Screw that Nintendo DS touch screen!  D Pad Mode Activate!**

Nintendo had a cardinal rule for developers, that they should try to impliment at least some sort of touch screen controls in about every game.  This definitely hurt many, that would have otherwise have been so much better without touch or stylus controls, such Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, Zelda: Spirit Tracks, Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, and so on!  In Xtras/PERM-CHEATS-PATCHING, are patches for these 3 games, to negate that annoyance!  No more Okami style drawing for DoS!  And, no dragging and dropping Link all over the place in his two adventures.  Enjoy the patches!  Be sure to check out all of the other patches in there, too.  I will add more in the future.

**RetroBoot for Playstation Classic!**

**RetroBoot Release should be posted within a short duration, time frame wise, as this Release!**

Genderbent, of the Playstation Classic Scene, has offered up an excellent alternative to AutoBleem and BleemSync. which outright ignores the Main UI, and strictly focuses on RetroArch Usage.  I have been extensively testing and trying out 4 different Modifications, related to the PS Classic...these being:

- RetroBoot - Focuses on RetroArch, not Carousel Main UI, whatsoever.
- BleemSync - Has support for RetroArch and Main UI
- AutoBleem - Also has support for RetroArch and Main UI
- PSpwned - Focuses mainly on simple, ease of use, Main UI usage (Not Released!)

Each of these has their perks and negatives.  I currently have 4 flash drives, one for each of them.  I enjoy using them all, randomly, and testing out different perimeters.  Suffice to say, PS Classic Modding is still very much in its infancy, and "Only Time Will Tell" how much potentially more awesome it will become.  We still have room for better Saturn, DraStic, even possibly Gamecube/Wii, to a lesser extent.  I could see some Wii Wads, such as Castlevania, Contra, Gradius Rebirth, slogging along at a well enough pace to be cool enough to enjoy!

In any case, Genderbent has asked me for permission to add stuff from my Releases into RetroBoot.  I gave
him the A OK.  And, I will keep in communication with him each concurrent Release, henceforth.  More information and details can be found within the PS CLASSIC folder.  Enjoy the myriad of options at your
disposal to give the best bang for your buck, PS Classic wise!  Speaking of which!...

**Compression Support for PSC Cores with AutoBleem/RetroBoot!**

**This is an experimental change**

Huge personal thanks to madmonkey for his original and amazing work with compression, which we have already made very practical use of on the NESC/SNESC, to utilize and install Cores at 75 percent smaller size!  Within the last 2 releases, I have been paying close attention to how long it generally takes you all to install the Modification and Cores.  Compression isn't as much a necessity on PSC as it is on NESC/SNESC.  Obviously, on the latter, we had to contend with a very limited 200 MB, give or take, for SNESC; 300 MB, give or take, for NESC!  This, quite frankly, made things pretty rough!  

In any case, we thought it would be a wonderful way to speed up the install process by having Cores at 75 percent smaller size on PSC, as well.  Genderbent and madmonkey were quite gracious and helpful in this entire process.  You can grab Genderbent's latest RetroBoot Release, today, as well...with full on Compression Support.  Not only that, Cores should load faster, too, with the help of another boost that is in place.  My main "injector" installer, which focuses on primary AutoBleem integration, also has this same Compression Support.  BleemSync should be implimenting this support, as well.  

Since it utilizes different initial paths (/media/bleemsync/opt/retroarch, versus /media/retroarch, I didn't want to overstep my boundaries and modify the integrity of how they have things set up.  They can personally add the Core Compression Support, as they deem fit.  In the meantime, I will leave the previous "injector" from 3-16-19 on the Mega NZ link, in PS CLASSIC, for bleemsync use!  Thanks again madmonkey and Genderbent for going way beyond the call of duty to help impliment this greatness for many to enjoy! 

If anyone notices any differences, lag, pauses, freezes, in any specific Cores, with this change...by all means, let me know.  I will react and update accordingly!  But, in testing, everything was running great!

**This also means!:)**

RetroArch has been updated for PSC, and many bugs are fixed up.  Thanks to Genderbent for helping clean things up!  You are less likely to get the black screen.  Instead, you will sometimes get kicked to RetroArch, not even the Modification Splash Screen.  This is great, as the PSC limiter is now becoming less of a nuisance, Modification wise!  It will still need to be accounted for, in the future, though!  Ideally, we will want to be able to use the back of the PSC with an OTG, or such, to bypass the limiter entirely!

**DOS, MSX, EasyRPG, etc, saves fixed for NESC/SNESC!**

This has been an annoyance for quite some time.  I give tremendous thanks to Beylie, gamecleaner, for helping test things.  And, as per usual, absolute gratitude to DanTheMan827 for helping this idea come to fruition!  Saves will be pushed to /var/saves instead of inside the CLV Folders!  In the past, any saves made with DOS, MSX, EasyRPG, and similarly minded Cores, would be deleted upon a resynch/reexport!  This is one of the best 
additions we have had, to date!  I will be covering more regarding DOS/MSX, etc, in the near future...including DOS-CD games, and so on.  I additionally added Xtras/MAPPING, a recommended mappings ReadMe!  This will be updated to account for stuff like general DOS games...and, of course Metal Gear for MSX, etc!  The way to map these is in the videos below.  Personal thanks to fr500 and r-type for their help on the original keyboard to controller mapping that I pushed for nearly 2 years+ ago that greatly improved ability to play these, formerly and nearly impossible to play without keyboard, games!!

**The Coolest Cat On The Block!  Introducing the VRC7 Chip Mode Activate!**

There are many chips used in various NES games.  Many of you may already be familiar with the incredible sound in the Japanese version of Akumajou Densetsu AKA Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse.  It is significantly better than the US version due to its inclusion of an incredible VRC6 Chip!  

The pinnacle achievement of NES sound, in my personal opinion, is the usage of VRC7 in the non-US Released Sci-Fi RPG made by none other than Konami...Lagrange Point.  In Xtras/PERM-CHEATS-PATCHING, is a translation patch for it.  And, if you update RetroArch Xtreme for NESC/SNESC...the chip will be active with ALL 3 NES Cores!

/bin/fceumm  /bin/nestopia  /bin/quicknes

The sound is in close approximation to the Yamaha YM2413, with a very nice subset of instrument sounds that would normally be thought of as near impossible to output from an NES game at the time!  Personal thanks to retro-wertz, rdanbrook, and NukeYKT for this amazing magic!  You can see it in action at the tail end of my, "How Xtreme is Xtreme Video", below!
 
**SNES9x 2018 Updated!**

WWF Wrestlemania: Arcade fixes (thanks for heads up on this, Ruby Eye Shabranigdu!), and so on...Bumped up to version 1.60!  Enjoy!

**NEO-GEO CD now has .wav support!**

You can now run .iso+.flac/ogg/and wav.  Yay!  Personal thanks to fabrice-martinez for this great fix, and BsLeNuL for helping test!

**Dreamcast Updated, yet again!**

Personal thanks to Autechre and Flyinghead for continuing to do some wonderful magic with the Accuracy portion of Dreamcast Emulation!  Reicast Accuracy, /reicast/accuracy for those on Mini NES/SNES, has been updated with a whole plethora of bug fixes, optimizations, and accuracy adjustments.  Have fun!

**We could all use "Little Magic"!:)

Great gem of a puzzle game, Little Magic, I have added SNES Cheats for...Infinite Lives Activate!  Thanks for the recommendation on this great game that I have never seen or heard of before, ItzMikeOmg!

**I'm all 'bout that mods, 'bout that source, no trouble!:)**

Over the last few years, I have been working with the Mini NES/SNES/PSC.  I have directly communicated and collaborated with many, many people.  This all ties together in helping get a better experience for all.  I vested a personal interest in many things related to the Cores AKA Emulators.  Initially, I worked with Cluster and pcm720, who were both great guys.  I helped troubleshoot PC side issues with hakchi2 and Mini NES bugs, as well.  Some great ground was covered as far as cleaning up the memory.  C8 errors were pretty rampant in the beginning!  Sooo much better now!  Those C8 errors were a different breed, and would make a system unbootable, until you hooked it back up to Hakchi2!  I then, of course, moved onto working with the Cores and RetroArch, since there was simply so much to do with both!  Nearly unlimited options, at the time, it seemed!  

Not too long after, I ended up getting into a random little debate with someone over whether or not 7z compression worked with a specific Core.  Someone argued it did.  I said it didn't.  Then, a third person got involved, who just so happened to be madmonkey, hehe.  The 7z that I referred to not working, was with specific variants of FBA 2012, them being CPS1, CPS2, NEO-GEO, whereas, it DID work with normal FBA 2012.  But, that is pretty much how we met.  We started private chatting, communicating about a few things and ideas.  We bsed about how it would be great to be able to play those MSU-1 Games on the Nintendo Classics!  Rock N'Roll Racing, specifically!  Soon enough, madmonkey made it happen...And, I posted "this" video:

**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxAjQ_7QHmg**

The initial process was not exactly user friendly.  So, I came up with a little word association to make it easier to digest...This being:

Seriously = Stock Kernel
Don't     = Dump Kernel  
U         = Unpack Kernel  
F'ing     = Flash Kernel
Remember  = Rebuild Kernel
Me?       = Memboot

It worked out, quite well...Most people had a much easier time remembering the steps that way!  And, we all got our Rock N'Roll Racing...Which I also did this Tutorial about:

**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOVwPWEOiUo**

Both Cluster and Madmonkey told me the stuff I was putting together RetroArch and Core wise was better than what was currently available...And, that I should set-up on Github.  And, that is how that happened:)

I was also already in contact with many other people in the Scene (In thank you section way above), as well as DanTheMan827, exceptional guy that I have had the pleasure of many hours of great conversation and collaboration with.  He is a stand-up guy, and is quite neutral and fair.  He does not hesitate to give me fair criticism, of which I always take seriously and to heart.  Many of them are in the Thank You section at the very top of this page!  Things just kept getting better and better..one milestone after another!  Hakchi2 CE, PSP, Dreamcast, Slow DS, Fast DS, Wi-Fi, and so on!  So much more to come!

CompCom and Swingflip came into play around the same time as the beginning of Hakchi2 CE and SNESC.  Both were very ambitious and passionate as far as how they wanted the Scene to go, moving forward.  They wanted to reach a broader audience, and make it an All-In-One solution.  Obviously, with so many people involved, creative differences were inevitable and unavoidable.  Yes, the drama has been real, at times!  It has been this way in pretty much every Scene over the years, including MAME!  But, it has most certainly been a very fun ride, nonetheless!  I wouldn't see it any other way, nor change anything:)  And, I am looking forward to seeing how much further we can go!  There will always be creative differences.  But, in the end, every one of you will have better overall enjoyment of your Mini Classics, as a result!

This now ties into the Source.  As I have been posting Releases since 2016, essentially...pre-Github, too...I have been in constant contact with the community, as a whole.  I would get an incredible amount of feedback related to anything I posted.  "This game doesn't work, there is a bug with this, etc."  This lead to closer collaboration with many great people in Libretro.  Literally a good 200+ people that have all been amazing with helping fix things up for all Platforms concerned!  fr500 was absolutely amazing in helping on one of my earliest gripes...the lack of keyboard to controller mapping support!  At first, he jokingly said..."just use a keyboard on PC..It works great!:)  But, low and behold, sure enough, after R-Type helped with a generic mapper for C64, which I posted in the Release...And, I did a showcase video of...here:

**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBn9MkHUA_E**

It was a huge hit amongst End Users...And, he took it to the next level...implimenting an even better method of doing it into BlueMSX, and so on.  This became an official change in RetroArch, to coincide with the specific PC Emulator Cores!  It all worked out so amazingly well!  The result of this change was seen in this video:

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMkkNaZ6WnI

What it all comes down to, essentially, is this...The most important aspect in any Scene, is the End User...you!  Your feedback means everything as far as getting all the ducks lined in a row, so to speak...and accounted for!  This great collaboration between End User, myself, and others in the Scene has lead to literally over 100 vast improvements, fixes, and so on...that all have been able to benefit from!  Let's keep the pure awesomeness going!  I am here to help you run, jump, and stomp some goombas, after all!  Let us all just coexist, as mentioned in the way top of the Release Notes:)  I try to be nice and polite and respectful with all I come into contact with, even if some decidedly like to be more mean spirited at times!

**WIP**

Some good stuff in the works, already, for Next Release...including Multi-Switching of Disks alternative method, a long lost relic system from my past, which now works on NESC/SNESC/PSC!  This will be revealed, soon.  Many will have never heard of it!  But, I have mentioned it several times in videos:)

**I am not a Robot.  So, a little bit of emotion will continue be in my Release Notes.  So, blog it up:)**

A certain individual, whom I "have" gotten along with great in the past, has made a very public apology for being mean spirited and generally giving me a hard time.  We still sorted things out and had an amicable arrangement, for the benefit of others we dealt with on a daily basis, however.  An apology is a real thing, that makes a difference. This arises out of another situation, that won't make sense to all of you.  But, it will involve smoother sailing for my Core Set Releases in the future.  And, it also shows that all people are capable of transcending beyond any misgivings, and truly making things right.

**My response to him:**

There was a time in the chat that you refer to, that I specifically stated to you one particular thing, "We have gotten along great, and despite you being mean spirited to me right now, you do not fully understand the situation and how things really are.  I am truly doing my best to get along with everyone and not ruin their days.  But, ultimately, what I do is to share my love of emulation, that I have had for 30+ years."  I have been poked at, prodded, teased, all that fun stuff.  This would be called Cyber Bullying in some circles.  But, I am a bit beyond letting stuff like that tear me down, as you have consistently seen in my actively troubleshooting, helping others, and maintaining a very respectful and cordial communication with you.  

Some things are blown way out of proportion, however.  Have no worries, the only reason I have not yet posted source amidst all of this "controversy" is due to the fact that I do work several jobs.  It is number one priority, and it will be posted so that ALL modifications, not just ONE, can equally use anything I post.  I am here to help the End User best enjoy their Mini Classics, and have less stress in their days.  So, rest assured, you will be able to fully use my Releases and have the !@#$ cleaned off of the fan, so to speak, within the next few days.  

Thank you very much for your heartfelt apology.  Things will work out, no worries.  And, there will be much more greatness to come!  

P.S. Yes, I have been still checking out your videos, just not commenting because the last time I tried to help you with a tip to run Commodore 64 faster, load wise, you may have unintentionally taken that personally.  I was, in fact, truly trying to share knowledge that you could use to help others.  At least one time in life, someone discovered duct tape was the one all solution to nearly everything:)  I like to share this metaphorical fact whenever I run into a similar obstacle, so all, including yourself can benefit!  Chat again, soon:)

Kyland... 

Thank you for your eloquent apology.  I wholeheartedly accept it, Patton.

**Aside from this, myself and another great individual have another previously non-working system lined up for you RetroEnthusiasts to enjoy Next Release!  This will be particularly most relevant to the Playstation Classic!  It will run on the Nintendo Classics, as well.  Just not as optimally.  See you all again, soon!  Thanks for reading** 

**3-16-19**

**Anyone who had trouble loading a select number of SNES Games.  That is now fixed.  Simply Update the Cores and RetroArch 1.7.6 Xtreme for Nintendo Classics, and install latest "injector" for PS Classic!**

Sorry for the delay!  Real World Problems:)

Back again for another Release, for both Nintendo and Sony Classics!  Many things are fixed up, Updated, accounted for!  I will continue to follow feedback, to make future adjustments, accordingly!  Remember, the Main Release: 

**KMFDManic-NESC-SNESC-PSC-Cores.3-16-19.Xtreme.7z**

Is now at way way way bottom of this page!  It was always at the top for the last gazillion Releases!  But, now, it is pretty much displaying at the bottom most portion!  So, keep that in mind!

**For Playstation Classic Users, navigate to Xtras/PS CLASSIC in Main Release, or any of the alternative links**

All of you Mini NES/SNES/PSC Enthusiasts have been truly great to me.  I appreciate all of the overwhelming and very positive responses!  So, here we go...Bullet Points, Videos, Closing Notes:

**Guess Who's Back, Back Again!? Hakchi 3.6.0 Release Candidate Incoming!**

In Xtras/Hakchi/Release Candidate!

Here you are, Guys and Gals...courtesy of DanTheMan827, a Release Candidate for Hakchi 3.6.0! Included is a .png, showing some of the added and very welcome changes! In the SD Folder, is what you would need if you want to run this Hakchi from SD Card!  Note, the card will be formatted!  Keep that in mind!

Your overall feedback and response is most welcome, in helping the final end result to be as best
as conceivably possible!

**Important Notes:**

- Again, the SD Card will be Erased for this process!

- sd.img.xz is the raw image that can be written from a computer with a sd reader**

- sd-installer.hmod has that same image inside it, but it will use the classic to write the image

- sd uboot needs to be flashed to use the hmod installer

Thanks in advance for any feedback.  And, truly incredible appreciation, on behalf of DanTheMan827!

**The Naysayers have failed!**

Never trust bad reviews, just on heresay!  Many of you, literally over 100+, have personally confirmed you have purchased a Playstation Classic, based on my recommendation of it being a worthwhile investment.  Those in the Mini NES/SNES Community already know I was supportive of the Beast, since Day 1.  Glad that those on the fence now see the true light and the amazing potential this portable console has!  It definitely goes nicely, hand in hand, with either the Mini NES/SNES, as well..supplemental wise!

**Windows 10?! What is officially accepted?**

Just because one owns a PC with Windows 10 as the pre-installed or recommended Operating System, does not...at all, mean they have to use it.  They can run older OS, such as Windows 7, 8, etc!  Many times, when I work on computers for people, they might have one of those Mini Laptops that inexcusably have lower hardware specs than the Operating System that is included should truly be running on!  They might complain about how utterly slow and sluggish and awful the computer runs!  I will do some optimizations and do what I can to help them run as best they can on these limited PCs.  But, sometimes, I suggest they downgrade to a less intensive one, such as Windows 7, and that has a remarkedly vast improvement, by using less Ram, System Resources, etc.  

Obviously, with planned obsolescence in play...many companies will attempt to "force" people to be on newer Operating Systems to support their newer printers, etc.  And, in contrast, you might have just gotten a new Windows 10 PC, and, found your reliably older printer is no longer supported in Driver Updates!  There are nearly always workarounds for this for those who are patient enough!  I am running Windows 10 with a Printer/Scanner, and other hardware configurations that I still have from my Windows XP days of scanning Nintendo Power and so on!  Yes, I will get back into the Nintendo Power scenario, when I have time to!

But, this same thing goes for my Core Set with the Mini PSC!  I am doing a mixture of libraries and dependencies, that are not necessarily of the metaphorical Windows 10 subset of system files, as an example!  This unofficial route allows me to take advantage of many exploits, which help run many Cores bigger, badder, and better.  There will always be hardware limitations on RetroPie, Mini NES/SNES, and Playstation Classic.  But, with a few Butterfly Mod Effects in place, things have worked out for the best!  My set will generally be Experimental, and remain this way.  I collaborate with hundreds of people on a very regular basis, from Libreto, to End Users, many new acquaintances and friends.  And, this all adds up to a very excellent and well working set, each and every Release.  If any issues turn up, many are more than happy to help test and help me quickly fix things up!  You will never ever have a perfect program, emulator, or so on!  That is just a fact of life!.  There is always room for improvement.

Just because someone tells you something, like with the "bad" Playstation Classic Reviews, you need not take it to heart as ironclad fact!  No one person can say to use this Modification over this one, or this over that, and so on.  This is ultimately up to "you", the End User...to decide what is best for your own personal set-up!       

**RetroArch 1.7.6?!**

When RetroArch Updates, it is baseline for PC Platforms, first and foremost.  But, many other platforms support it as well.  This essentially means that there are many additions and changes which will have little or no effect on one platform over another.  1.7.3 was a big deal because of the huge overwrite of how input mapping worked; 1.7.5 was because of the vast overhaul to the Cheat System to make them more operational and reliable, as a whole...as well as some stability fixes for things that were previously broken...by the "butterfly mod effect"; 1.7.6, more or less, has "some" additions that will simply not work for us, currently...such as the Main UI Interface you see me using in my Playstation Classic Videos.  That, for the moment, works on devices that have hardware acceleration of some sort...of which the PS Classic does, to a degree.

For AutoBleem/BleemSync, I updated RetroArch to 1.7.6, to replace 1.7.5c in the "injector".  

For the Mini NES/SNES, I am not yet comfortable enough to "jump" to 1.7.6, as some of the notable changes have no applicable use on those Platforms.  And, like with previous RetroArchs, I like to get some field testing in.  For Playstation Classic, things passed my Seal of Approval with flying colors.  But, on the former systems, I am still very fond of the foundation that is 1.7.5, which most effortlessly works with my current incarnation of the Core Set.  Obviously, I will continue testing things.  If I see it worthwhile to bump to 1.7.6, I will do so.  You have the perfect right to try 1.7.6 out, if you so choose to.  But, if you encounter any instability or brokenness from what you have become accustomed to, just come back to 1.7.5 Xtreme!  For all things considered, a later version of 1.7.6 or even an earlier one of the upcoming 1.7.7 might be the one I decide to make the cut.  

**Speaking of which!**

After careful consideration, and multiple people requesting it, I have opted to make the Main RetroArch Interface more classically attuned to the Playstation XMB, much like Mini NES/SNES/PC Users have become accustomed to, over the years.  Certain things, such as display of box art, etc, are more favorably optimal, with that mode.  This change was mostly done due to End User Request.  Not to mention, simply dropping artwork into the folders, will nicely showcase it, whilst navigating that folder for Load Content!  

I pay attention to any and all feedback, and will fix things up accordingly, each and every Update..to try to satiate everyone to their best wants, desires, needs, interests.

**2 Player Mode Activate?**

Yes, of course, we want to do 2 Player Mode Activate!  With one controller in Port 1 and USB Flash Drive in Port 2, this can be a problem!!!  So, then...this leads into:

**Recommendations, now that I have purchased a Playstation Classic!?**

An investment you will want will be a Powered USB Hub.  This will counteract the limiter, so that you can run 2 Player Mode Activate!  What is this limiter?  Keep in mind, some of what I say applies to older AutoBleem/BleemSync Variants.

Generally, the USB Ports are limited to 100mA power draw.  If you exceed that, the USB Drive, typically in Port 2...will have instability, not work, or outright crash.  Those who have used a Mini NES/SNES, are already aware of C2, C3, C7, C8, etc errors.  On PS Classic, these do not display.  Your system simply powers off on older versions of the various Modifications.  This can occur from a C7, which means destination not found or incompatible, amongst other things.  You might get this from trying to load an unsupported file with whichever Core.  Usually, you'd get kicked back to RetroArch.  But, depending on how the error interacts, you might get a power down.

If running the more memory dependent Cores, such as Reicast, and a select few others, you might find memory can max out after loading a few games...with just a controller in Port 1 and USB Flash Drive in Port 2.  After a certain point, memory can become unstable, and lead to a power down or kick back to RetroArch.  But, you can just power right back on, and load right back into another game, without issue!  It is mainly if the system does NOT power down, that you will have the recommendation from myself to do a disk check on PC for corruption.  

And, some Cores, in fact...may not even work properly, at all, unless you are able to account for the power limitations!  Obviously, you will be fine with most of them, such as NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, Atari 2600, and...otherwise lower cpu/gpu dependent ones.  But, get into a few of the more stubborn ones, attempting to load may potentially lead to system powering off or being kicked, instead.  So, if you are at all serious about 2 Player Mode Activate, or running some of the more intensive Cores, a USB Powered Hub is an absolute must recommendation!

There are hard mods to remove the limitations of the limiter...But, I would emphasize and strongly suggest only doing such a thing if you feel you can handle them without doing any damage.  I won't ever show how to do these, as hard mods are not something I want to take any responsibility for.  Soft mods are nearly always fixable...Hard Mods, not necessarily so!  I am most certainly not going to be any part of that:)

I have tested the latest versions of both AutoBleem/BleemSync, and how the limiter crashes are handled are far better than in previous Releases.  You are way more likely to get booted to the main AutoBleem/BleemSync Splash Screens instead of a power down!  So, they are both more than suitable choices for your set-up, in their current state!  

**Compatibility for PCSX ReArmed NEON Vastly Superior to any prior Release! For Mini NES/SNES/PSC!**

This has actually been an off and on WIP Project over the last 2 years.  One of my favorite original PS1 Games, Parasite Eve 2, has had bad dynamic recompiler conflicts...of which I have covered before in a few videos, as well as Release Notes.  I released an Xtreme PCSX ReArmed NEON Variant which actually helped that and several other games run better, like Xtreme Games!  But, it broke other games, such as Crash Bandicoot!  So, where it would make games like Ridge Racer play bigger, badder, better than ever before, the FMV in Crash, pretty much slowed to a crawl!  There were desynch issues, where the audio/video would get lost, trip, and crash the game, because Dynamic Recompiler could not keep its place in the game, so to speak.  

There were a few ways around this, such as outright disabling Dynamic Recompiler.  But, then you would be running games as slow as Yabause, Virtual Jaguar, 4DO, and PC-FX...Other Cores that don't properly have Dynamic Recompiler incorporated to more optimally run these cpu/gpu intensive games on lower spec hardware!

In any case, Bslenul and myself have been painstakingly testing some mathematical variants, as far as the timing differentials and clock speed.  Lower Spec Hardware tends to run best when underclocked, as it puts less work on the emulator (Core), itself.  But, the Mini NES/SNES really isn't as low spec as you might believe.  It is still pretty much a solid work horse, capable of much awesomeness.  So, an overclock is now in place, which now fixes "many" of  the previously unworking, unstable, crashing, otherwise problematic games, such as Parasite Eve II, NBA Live 98, 2000, and 2001, Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, ESPN Xtreme Games, and so on!  

You will need RetroArch Xtreme and the Updated PCSX ReArmed NEON Core installed to take advantage of these amazing changes for the Mini NES/SNES!  For PS Classic, install the latest "injector".  

Personal thanks to others who have had vested interests and have also tested some of the perimeters, such as Gingerbeardman, AnotherLife, Madmonkey, gpstar, and especially retro-wertz...who has been amazing and helpful in some of the other previous PCSX fixes and adjustments!  There are other great fixes in place for PCSX, this time around, as well...such as some games not working properly with 2nd memory card disabled.  These are few and far between, though!

Be sure to let me know if you discover any other previously broken games that are affected by these compatibility and performance fixes!

**Playstation Games' Slowdown Be Gone & High Definition Mode Activate!**

For Nintendo Classics & PS Classic, Updating will solve many Slowdown Issues on troublesome games!  High Definition Mode will work on more games with the Nintendo Systems, and nearly EVERY game for PS Classic, this time around!  You will get occasional hiccups and minor slowdown on somes games with HD activated.  You can toggle the two HD Options on in Core Options.  Without HD, nearly every game plays with minimal to no slowdown!

Additionally, 2D games on the real hardware had some really awful artifacts which made games age horribly.  Some fixes are in place to eliminate these artifacts and have a much cleaner and nicer appearance, especially for any and all 2D games!  Retry Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, to see what I mean!  I showcase a few examples in the Video below!  

**Diablo Music Fixed for Playstation Version!**

Certain conditions lead to the loss of music in Diablo!  We can't have this!  With PCSX ReArmed Xtreme NEON, go to Core Options, toggle on Diablo Music Fix!  Make sure to toggle it back off for other games, as it may conflict with some!  Thanks to retro-wertz for helping with this tremendous and welcome fix!

**One Final thing for PS1 Games...How about a Batch Converter, to get them all into Eboots!?**

Personal thanks to Justme488, who took the time to set up a batch script to work with the PSX2PSP Program.  You can get both in Xtras/Tools/PS1.  You can literally convert your entire set of PS1 Games to Eboots, within reason...over the course of multiple hours!  Instructions are included:)  Thanks again, Justme488!

**Dreamcast Reicast Xtreme Updated!**

PS Classic Users, just install the latest "injector".

Appropriate Command Lines for the Update (Mini NES/SNES Users) are:

- /bin/reicast <rom> <clover_args> (triggers Reicast Xtreme Mode Activate! - Requires RetroArch 1.7.5+!)
- /bin/reicast-accuracy <rom> <clover_args> (triggers Reicast Accuracy Mode Activate! - Requires RetroArch 1.7.5+!)
- /bin/reicast-standard <rom> <clover_args> (triggers Reicast Standard Mode Activate! - Works with RetroArch 1.7.4-1.7.5+!)

**Special Notes:**

Some Naomi/Atomiswave/Stubborn Dreamcast Games may work better in Reicast Standard Mode Activate,
due to the increased accuracy of Reicast Xtreme Mode Activate! /bin/reicast-standard

CHD Compression will work best with /bin/reicast (Xtreme Mode Activate!)
It also works with /bin/reicast-accuracy (Accuracy Mode Activate! But, at the cost of performance!)

**Dreamcast VMU (Visual Memory Unit) for Playstation Classic!**

This is inside Xtras/Games.  I recommend creating a _DUMMY Folder in outset of your flash/hard drive.  Make a DREAMCAST Folder within, and copy the VMU to it.  Then, when you go to Load Core/Content, navigate to this _DUMMY Folder.  Load the VMU (Visual Memory Unit), with which you can micromanage your saves for Sega Dreamcast Games!  More on _DUMMY below!

**2 NEW Cores for Playstation Classic!**

Those of you on the SNES/NES Classics will already be familiar with the FBA 2018 and NEO-GEO CD 2018 Cores!  They now run near flawlessly for the Playstation Classic!  You will need BIOS for NEO-GEO CD, which are covered in the Xtras/BIOS/Folder!  NEO-GEO CD Demonstration in Videos below!  Note: Some Cores like FBA 2018 and NEO-GEO CD 2018 sometimes need to be run in a special way, to avoid tripping the limiter, without a peripheral USB-HUB or such being utilized.  I cover this in my video below!

**How do I run NEO-GEO CD?**  

This is one of a special few case scenario Cores, that may require an additional step to run, especially if running via the obstacle of the PS Classic Limiter, without Powered USB-HUB!  But, no worries, there is a workaround exploit to get up and running!  I showcase this in the video section!

The primary Tutorial for NEO-GEO CD conversion is also linked to.  Once you have you end result, simply make a folder for the pertinent NEO-CD game, in your _DUMMY or whichever other Games folder you are currently using!  It is best to have games with multiple files, in their own folders, to avoid your own confusion with organization!

**Speaking of _DUMMY!?**

The best procedure to follow to avoid some potential issues, is to Load Core, then Load Content.  This _DUMMY Folder has been a huge asset and basis for my set-up on the Mini NES/SNES for the last 2 years.  And, it is pretty much how I have been doing things on my Android Phone for years.  It is also exceptionally helpful in preordained .uae files for use with Amiga, and so on.  This will be covered more in another Tutorial, upcoming.    

**Games for Playstation Classic!**

Aside from the Dreamcast VMU, that I covered above...I have included several Games that you should definitely check out...also, in Xtras/Games!  Enjoy some amazing gaming, such as Cave Story Ports, Rick Dangerous Clone, some Zelda'esque NES, and so on!  I will add more in the future!

Of course, those on Mini NES/SNES, using Hakchi2 CE 3.5.2, can grab these games from KMFD Mod Hub!  I will update so all 3 systems can continually enjoy the greatness, on all fronts!

**Installation Updated for Playstation Classic, for my Xtreme, "Beast Mode Activate" Core Set Release!**

Xtras/PS CLASSIC, will have updated "injectors" and installation instructions for AutoBleem/BleemSync, etc!

My personal set-up consists of 4 Flash Drives...One with BleemSync, One with AutoBleem, One with RetroBoot, One with PSpwned!  I try to account for all set-ups in my testing perimeters!  Being that this is still a very new Modding Scene...it will take time for any of the 4 Modifications, as well as any others, to truly reach phenomenally high plateaus, as Hakchi has already done on the Mini NES/SNES.  But, they are all quite excellent, considering they are less than a few months old!

Flash Drive wise, without a Powered USB-HUB, I have personally found 16 GB and smaller drives to work great.  If you want to run 32 GB or larger, it is generally best to have the HUB!  I will likely never recommend the hard mod method.    

Again, you can grab the latest Core Set Release for PS Classic, inside Xtras/PS CLASSIC!  View the ReadMe for installation to get you on your way to more pure awesomeness!  

**Turbografx-16/CD Slowdown Fixes!**

Personal thanks to those who have given me the heads up that he was encountering a little slowdown on some games.  This was present on the real hardware, as well.  I put in a few fixes to help things along.  And, TG-16/CD games should run considerably better.  I will also look into seeing whether or not some games, that have graphical glitches...might potentially be able to be accounted for in a follow-up Release.

**More SNES Slowdown Fixes!**

A ton of feedback on the SNES Games!  Some people reported having issues with a select number of .Sfrom Games, etc.  Update the SNES Cores and RetroArch 1.7.5 Xtreme, and you will be fine, Mini NES/SNES wise.  For PS Classic, do an update install of the newer "injector".  In general, .sfc/.smc is more reliable on the Nintendo Classics, if choosing to run via any of the SNES9x Cores...I will refer to them that way, henceforth!  But, the fixes will help you run .Sfroms on SNES9x Cores, for the most part, as well.  Remember, some games with patches and header conflicts, will potentially have issues, unless double patched for both.

One game that may not be able to be fixed for the Nintendo Classics is Mega Man X2.  It is a special chip game with some complex graphical calculations.  As a result, more powerful hardware is pretty much a necessity on this one.  The Bubble Crab Stage is the worst example of slowdown the game has to offer.  On PS Classic, however, the game fares far much better!  So, aside from Full Speed Ahead Ninja Baseball Batman Irem Arcade...our second solid reason for a PS Classic is much more playable Mega Man X2!  You can see me running that dreaded stage with minimal to no slowdown in the 3rd Beast Mode Activate Video below!!!  Personal thanks to kps501/byuu/and, anyone else who has ever worked with the SNES9x Emulator, over the years...as well as sgtmerrill for testing and giving feedback on the Nintendo Classic front.

As far as the FX/FX2 Games, the general rule of thumb is to run them on Canoe, if at all possible to, Nintendo Classics wise.  Otherwise, run them on SNES9x 2010!  For PS Classic, they will run fine on SNES9x 2018!

Canoe Wise, vary the end command line argument trigger to be a variance of 1.5 to 8, as per the below examples:

- Dirt Racer
- Dirt Trax FX
- Doom
- Star Fox

/bin/clover-canoe-shvc-wr -rom /var/games/CLV-U-GURDM/Star_Fox.sfrom.7z --volume 100 -rollback-snapshot-period 600 -boost-fx 8 -no-lowlatency

- Star Fox 2
- Stunt Race FX
- Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island
- Vortex
- Winter Gold  

/bin/clover-canoe-shvc-wr -rom /var/games/CLV-U-JIHKI/Winter_Gold.sfrom.7z --volume 100 -rollback-snapshot-period 600 -boost-fx 1.5 -no-lowlatency

As you can see, the variance of 1.5 to 8 will be what is needed to help.  As more people give me their results, I will make the final numbers more ironclad.  But, 8 works best for games, such as Star Fox 1 and 2, Stunt Race FX, and 1.5 for Winter Gold (Thanks Gingerbeardman and company, on that result!  And, also thanks to PepinleBref69 for being very happy to help test these changes!)

**Final Notes**

Other Cores and such that have been Updated are dated 3-16-19, and have the same and usual bug fixes, updates, etc.  Many other things Updated, such as RetroArch 1.7.5/1.7.4 Xtreme, etc.  I have also included, for Mac Users, an unarchiver, so they can use the "injector" on their PCs.  In testing, the install worked out better for those using the "injector" method.  That is why I stuck with it in this concurrent Release.   

Personal thanks to DRVR 99, Dank games, Greenchili, IncendiaryIdea, and anyone else who has helped with testing and feedback!  And, thanks to Genderbent, a great buy...who works on RetroBoot.  I will cover more on that post-Release!

I will be doing a little Updating to the Mega NZ Link, by next Release.

Hello Everyone!  The Release was a tremendous success, with hundreds giving very positive feedback!  Of course, as with anything, there may be a few issues to contend with, things to fix up, etc!  I will take several of the suggestions, comments, messages into account!  Expect another follow-up Release within a few days for some more bigger, badder, better than ever stuff for your Mini NES/SNES/PSC!  Thanks again, all of you!!!

And, on a special side note...Every April Fool's Day, there tends to be a crazy flood of Pranks.  I may do the opposite and get something very special out to you all, just because April Fool's Day need not always be dreaded as a day of Pranksters!  

See you in a few days!  

P.S. I have received literally hundreds of messages, comments, etc.  I will be catching up on all of them over the next day or two!

**First of all, thanks to all of you, 500 plus total...that have continually been persistent about me getting onto the PS Classic!  I have been sick with light pneumonia for nearly a month, which threw things off a bit!  Plus a few other fun factors, such as -20 windchill temperatures, 70+ MPH windstorms, as seen in my Viral Video from last Release, and so on!  But, I am back now, in nearly full force...as seen with the last two Updates!  This time around, not only will get an Update for the NES/SNES Classics...but, also the PS Classic!  Full Speed Ahead...Xtreme Mode Activate!...err BEAST Mode Activate!!!**

**BIOS Printer Friendly Cheat Sheet has been Updated!**

Personal thanks to Justme488 and Antifly for their collaboration on this.  It is in Xtras/BIOS!  It will make knowing what you need for any given Core all that much easier!  BIOS, the set of instructions that run any given system, are the single most important aspect to even getting several of these up and running!  So, check it out!  Hope it makes the whole Modding Process easier for you all!  As always, feel free to ask questions!  You can install BIOS detailed in the PDF, by using Master BIOS Module in the main Core Set Release.  Simply copy the pertinent BIOS files into the root/system, then install like any other HMOD!  

Another trick you can utilize, which I will link to a video I did awhile back, showcasing this...You can use RetroArch UI, which can be grabbed from KMFD Mod Hub, synch/export it, then Load Core, scroll down to Information/Core Information, and verify whether BIOS are Present.  Note: Just because some BIOS say Optional, does not mean they should be overlooked.  I recommend using BIOS, where applicable...For example, PCSX ReArmed NEON, despite saying Optional...You will have some bad memory card/compatibility issues with many games...if you do not have BIOS!  ALL BIOS are case sensitive!  Keep that in mind:)

**Butterfly Mod Redux!**

What many of you might not have realized from the last few Updates, is that many of the changes were done in such fashion to directly correlate to compatibility, performance, and speed...for not only the Mini NES/SNES...but, also the PS Classic!  A lot of testing and multiple builds were done to try to arrive at the best possible end results for all Systems involved.  I give huge personal thanks to Dank Games, DRVR 99, Gravy, for helping stress test many perimeters, to give me a beneficial 2nd, 3rd, 4th opinion, and so on!  It all worked out for the best!

I have pretty much been working on this side project Release since January, when and where I could.  I am happy to now bring it on and share it with all of you who have been following me for the last 2 years in the Mini Scene...as well as newcomers alike.

**PS Classic, Should I Buy One?!  Hell Yeah! Nuff Said! Byeee!!!**

I found it nearly of epic and absurd proportions, how many immediately latched onto the bandwagon of giving the PS Classic abnormally bad reviews.  I stated months ago, it would be a Modder's Paradise.  This is beyond 110 percent true, at this point!  As a vanilla system, yes, things are arguable.  But, pretty much everyone and their mother and their father and their brother and their dog and so on...just had to critically bash the poor machine.  Yes, Sony had a few missteps with their overall Release, from the sorry line-up of games, to going the easier route of PCSX ReArmed, default emulator...versus the tried and true, fan favorite, POPS...which even I, myself, personally loved on my PSP and PS3, and so on!  

How many of you have seen a movie that had gotten really awful Critic Reviews, but really loved it, regardless!?  Notable examples for me would be Super Troopers, The Last Dragon (Not "that" Bruce Lee!), The Sandlot, Spaceballs, Step Brothers, Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, Tango & Cash, not to mention...many Troma Films, Trey Parker and Matt Stone's failed live action efforts Basketball and Orgazmo.  I can list off a multitude of movies, as I am pretty sure all of you can, as well.  Never let the naysayers and critics sway you, one way or another.  Most of you had an inkling you would want a PS Classic for potential modding purposes!  But, several of you have already told me, in conversations, that you didn't get one...or, even canceled preorders, due to these horrid reviews!

Fact remains, as you will see with This Release, the PS Classic is pretty much a Beast, in many respects!  You will get Full Speed Ahead with this Core Set Update, and really and honestly and truly be able to better enjoy your overall nostalgic gaming experience!  MAME 2003 Xtreme, will net you 25-33 percent nominal gains over an unfactored in, two years ago, MAME 2003 Standard Core on the NES/SNES Classic!  With the last Updates, and MAME 2003 Xtreme, particularly...even NES/SNES Classic gains 10-15 percent in improvements, performance and speed wise.  These changes, while grueling to test, worked out well beyond my expectations.  

Sega System 32 games are near flawless on Mini NES/SNES/PS Classic, now!  And, the stubborn ones, such as Alien 3: The Gun, Outrunners, Jurassic Park, while running well enough to be enjoyable on NES/SNES, run pretty spectacularly on the PSC!  

Run and Gun, a very tough to run game, which markwkidd helped me get bootstrapped in for the Mini NES/SNES, awhile back, performs exceedingly well on the PSC, with the changes in place!

Taito F3 Games run way better on PSC, such as Grid Seeker, Gekirandan (Now, it really does feel like you are playing a Sega Saturn Game, Full Speed Ahead, on your PSC!)

You will see me showcase many games in the below Videos!  Games you have previously deemed stubborn, definitely try out, again...on the new Core Set Release!  You might be thoroughly surprised at some of the results!  Several of these changes, that contribute to the better performance/speed/pure awesomeness, have been rolling out over my last few Updates!  Quite a bit of collaboration, testing, and all that jazz, had been going on behind the scenes.  We are finally there, Guys and Gals!  Now then...

**I don't yet have a PS Classic, is it better than the SNES/NES Minis?!**

Buying a PS Classic is an absolute given for any serious or casual Modding Enthusiast, bar none!  But, there are most definitely several nuances to adjust to!  I will cover some of these in videos and future Release Notes, of course!  For now, if you are "on the fence", so to speak...as far as even considering buying one...definitely check out the videos and you will see some of the incredible feats and accomplishments the little PS Classic Beast is capable of!  Beast Mode Activate!

The NES/SNES Minis are very well made, have 2 solid years of Modding Ingenuity behind them, have most potential issues sorted, and are quite reliable as far as doing what you want them to do!  There is still a bit of room for more fun and improvement.  I will keep on keeping on with Releases related to them both.  

The PS Classic is still in its infant stage.  Although it has better hardware specs, and can really be on the lines of, as I mentioned, "Beast Mode Activate"...with this current Core Set Release...It definitely has its share of issues to contend with, such as a generally steep learning curve, a ton of room for Modding Improvement, minor power fallacies which will improve after time.  

I personally love having both, NES/SNES, as well as PS Classic.  They have enough perks to warrant purchase of both, or all 3!  You can run most stuff, absolutely fine, with my Xtreme Core Set and RetroArch Xtreme, on Mini NES/SNES.  But, PS Classic, with my Core Set for that, better excels with PSP/Dreamcast/Amiga, and other generally stubborn Cores!  But, unfortunately, ones that have dynamic recompiler issues, are negligible as far as improvement.  These would be PCSX ReArmed, which runs only a tad better; 4DO, Yabause, BSNES, PC-FX, and a select few others.  These simply will not be any better unless some more comprehensive work is done.

As mentioned previously, Yabause has issues with properly hooking up to Dynamic Recompiler.  So, until that is worked out, the Core is more of a gimmick than anything to take seriously!  I will keep you posted if anything changes.  Kronos is our other alternative, which might be able to be gotten working, as well!

For now, more Cores and such work on Mini NES/SNES, than on PS Classic.  That could change, in the future.  I will work on getting more to be compatible, of the ones that don't currently work.  These will roll out in future Releases.  

On to... 

**How do I get started with the PS Classic!?**

I will not, at all, play any favoritism.  But, I did not feel comfortable enough recommending any specific Modding Solution, a few months ago.  There simply were some factors that needed a little time to adjust to, before I could comfortably decree any of them safe.  This, being aside from the PSpwned, that I showcased a little while back!

Bleemsync (Pat Hartl) and Autobleem (screemerpl) are the two primary, current, go to Modding Outlets to get the "hacks" in place, right now.  Both are excellent options, with their own set of nuances and learning curves.  As mentioned in the previous Release, we are essentially on a Final Frontier, where no man/woman has quite gone before.  I would best recommend being very patient with those who actively work on these modifications.  Avoid getting worked up, frustrated, angry, because things don't work or go the way you want them to.  

Most of us in the Modding, or any scene, for that matter...do this stuff so others, like yourselves, can enjoy it!  Many of us have Day/Night Jobs, and this is a hobbyist thing!  So, take things with a grain of salt, before you start dragging your heart around!

That being said...

**How do I install the PS Classic Xtreme Core Set?!**

 in Xtras/PS Classic, are the essential Tools, Information, etc, you will need to get started!  BleemSync/AutoBleem will be your two options to start with.  You will also find in there, the "_km_psc_xtreme_core_set_injector"!  Simply run it.  And, point it to your Flash Drive!  If using AutoBleem, just install directly to flash drive, as is!  If BleemSync, navigate the installation to be at bleemsync/opt/  It will install all you need regarding RetroArch, Xtreme Cores, and so on!  If it prompts to overwrite any existing files, on installation, confirm YES...and, allow it to do so.

There is a truly delicate balance between power consumption and performance and overall stability.  Assuming you are running the main PS Classic, with just a standard flash drive in Controller USB Port number 2, with an equivalent to Mini NES/SNES USB Power Source...RetroArch and some Cores can run into a few snags, which can lead to inevitably crashing your system to a shut-down.  We will try to iron some of these out.  Myself and a few others have very carefully and painstaking tested power/performance differentials out, accordingly.  And, I have arrived at a simple, yet elegant, solution...as you will see when you run RetroArch!  Many stress tests have been done, with higher cpu/gpu intensive Cores passing with flying Colors, with the current state of my Release.  Most standard USB Chargers, with at least 5 volts and 1 amp, will work fine...in the finished product!

I am going to maintain things in a way, so that previous Users of NESC/SNESC may more easily acclimate to the PS Classic.  There are obviously going to be a few nuances to adjust to, accordingly.  But, that was pretty much a given, from the start!  The _DUMMY Folder Method I outlined in a ton of my videos, is the primary way of running games on PSC, for now.  I have always been very partial to this method on the Mini NES/SNES!  It is nice, easy, very convenient.  It is no different on PSC.  Simply Click Load Core, Load Content, navigate to MEDIA, then the directory of your choosing.  I personally just toss a _DUMMY Folder into the outset of the drive!

**What about PSpwned!?**

PSpwned is a 3rd, yet unreleased, still WIP modification for the PS Classic.  Both BleemSync and AutoBleem have hit some extraordinary strides, given how early we are into the PS Classic Modding Scenario!  They both take into account more advanced specifics, such as databases to help with year games were made, what companies made them, and so on.  PSpwned, in the end, I feel...may be a simple, yet elegant solution.  It is already set-up in such a way, where adding games is very easy.  Hakchi implemention may still work out, as shown in my test video awhile back!  DanTheMan827 and myself have been communicating about this.  PSpwned will be meant as an alternative means for those who want just want to run things out of the box, with minimal effort.  Time will decide how this all works out.  But, I am happy with all 3 Solutions.  I have personally tested them.  And, I could go with any of the 3, if I needed to!  For now, check out BleemSync/AutoBleem.  They are both quite admirable solutions!  

Personal thanks to Madmonkey for the exorbitant effort he has put forth with lolhack and the unreleased PSpwned!  More in future Updates and Videos regarding this:)

**Dreamcast bigger, badder, better than ever!**

Personal thanks to to Frapcaster, DRVR 99, and anyone else who has given me test feedback.  I have been going through countless changes with the Cores, so they are as best representative of performance, speed, and overall awesomeness on the Mini NES/SNES, as well as the PS Classic.  This time around, the Core runs better than it has ever ran before.  Enjoy Marvel vs Capcom 2 on the NESC/SNESC in truly playable fashion!  And, on PS Classic, Ikaruga, a pretty stubborn game on the former, runs quite a deal better!  

You will have 3 Command Lines to utilize, depending on how you decidedly want to run your games...

/bin/reicast for Xtreme Mode Activate!  Most DC games will run very nicely with this particular path.

/bin/reicast-standard for Standard Mode Activate!  This is most effective for Naomi/Atomiswave Games, such as Metal Slug 6, Dolphin Blue, etc.  In Xtras/Dreamcast, are the .lst files you need to run these.  Simply add the .lst file as a game, making sure it is not compressed.  Then, copy the pertinent data files into the same CLV.  

/bin/reicast-chd for CHD Compression Mode Activate!  This allows CHD Compression, which can take several games down from ridiculous 1+ GB sizes to only a measly 33 MB-200 MB average!  This is a very nice way to run Dreamcast Games on NAND, without USB-HOST!  But, this comes at a performance cost, especially on more cpu/gpu intensive games.  I would mainly recommend this for those who have limited space, want to try it on NAND, or are on PS Classic...where, of course, the performance hit is much much less! 

Again, the videos will showcase these perimeters in action, as well as some nuances to adjust to, per usual!  

**Speaking of Dreamcast, VMU fixed up, again!**

It now works fine in Xtreme Mode Activate, /bin/reicast  Simply redownload from KMFD Mod Hub, and synch/export!  I know, normally, one cannot synch Dreamcast to NAND, under typical circumstances!  But, I will still help NAND Users embrace Dreamcast Emulation with their more limited resources in my Video Tutorial!

**PPSSPP Xtreme Updated for PS Classic!**

You will find a very nominal performance boost in many respects, better compatibility, and overall...much better experience.  Previously stubborn games, such as Ultimate Ghosts n'Ghosts...which, by the way, is the base game that many have wanted to run on Mini NES/SNES!...now works much better than ever before!  Just try it, for yourself, and be truly amazed!  

Between Reicast Xtreme and PPSSPP Xtreme, you will find 15-25+ percent performance boosts.  Reicast Xtreme, as mentioned, will benefit improvements on the Mini NES/SNES, as well!  But, unfortunately, due to the limitations of these latter systems, PPSSPP Xtreme is pretty much as good as it will get on those!  But, definitely enjoy the vastly superior Dreamcast/PSP experience on the PS Classic, where applicable.  And, enjoy better Dreamcast on your Mini NES/SNES, too!

You will also find many more games are Compatible than ever before for both Systems!!!

Personal thanks to hrydgard for his truly excellent work with PPSSPP...And, Autechre and flyinghead for theirs on Reicast!

**Amiga better than ever on PS Classic ONLY, for now!**

P-UAE Xtreme is now more capable of running most, non-AGA games, at full speed ahead...with amazing sound quality!  Shadow of the Beast is absolutely flawless, now!  You can Direct Load most games, with the appropriate BIOS set-up, which is detailed in the Xtras/BIOS PDF.  You can install these using Master BIOS Module.  I showcase this in action, in the video!  I will do an Updated Tutorial to make things easier, regarding a few other specifics, related to Amiga!

Both P-UAE Cores Updated.

**SNES Slowdown Be Gone!**

Like the previous Releases with the very sensitive timing fixes to help NES/GENESIS...this time around, SNES gets fixed up, in more ways than one!  I had base test games for NES (Contra Force/BattleToads, Genesis (Sparkster/Air Diver), SNES (you will see in the video below!), that needed to be very carefully tested to avoid breaking things.  I initially got to the mouse chasing me on the handlebars stage, in BattleToads...which is absolutely impossible to beat, if timing differential is offset by even a remote fraction.  So, in essence, going through that game several times...was what needed done to fully test these changes!  Save States couldn't really be viable means of knowing, since earlier stages could have consequences, as well!  It all worked out.  All 3 of these Systems run far better now, and timing is harmonious and very realistically plausible, as a result!  See for yourself, in the Showcase Video, what I mean:)  Different fixes apply for FX Games! Personal thanks to kps501, madmonkey, byuu!  And, thanks to RubyEyeShabranigdu for testing!  

**SNES FX Games!?**

The following games have proven to be quite pesky to run on about any set-up!

- Dirt Racer
- Dirt Trax FX
- Doom
- Star Fox
- Star Fox 2
- Stunt Race FX
- Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island
- Vortex
- Winter Gold

I have worked in some fixes to help these on Mini NES/SNES/PS Classic.  If on SNES Classic, a majority of these are best run using Sfroms!  Using hakchi, make sure Sfrom Conversion is enabled.  Add the games, as is.  Then, after the fact, go to the very end of the Command Line.  After one space, add the following to said Argument:

-boost-fx 8 -no-lowlatency

Quick reminder:  If you need to apply any patches, grab them from the DarkAkuma Link at top of my page, along with the Sfrom Tool.  These can be used with Hakchi 3.5.2 CE.

If on NES Classic, this above method will only be an option if you are running Dual Boot/HSQS Firmware Method, and so on.  I ran SNES Classic Firmware on NES Classic, and Canoe games ran absolutely fine using the perimeter.

SNES9x Cores are another alternative to this.  On Mini NES/SNES, they will only work well on SNES9x 2005/2005 Plus/2010...Not at all good on SNES9x 2016/2018 due to the overall accuracy.

On PS Classic, they will work fine on SNES9x 2005/2005 Plus/2010/2016/and 2018!

RetroArch Xtreme is recommended to be used in conjunction for best results...especially if you are planning on running MSU-1 Variants of any of these!  If going the MSU-1 route, these will only work on SNES9x 2016/2016 Bright/and 2018!  On Mini NES/SNES, you will get some slowdown or occasional lag, again...due to the additional accuracy.  But, on PS Classic, these mostly run fine!

This is something I have been playing around with off and on, over the last 2 years.  FX Games have nearly always been an issue on about any Emulator I have ever run them on.  If Sfroms are an option, go that route for these ones.  If not, follow the SNES9x Core recommendations I laid out.     

Simply Update the SNES Core/s, and run with RetroArch Xtreme!

**DraStic Updated, again:)**

Thanks for the test feedback.  A few things were accounted for, and fixed!  Thanks for the great test feedback D. Dynadan and everyone else who has relayed results to me!  

To Reiterate...the set-up for running DraStic is as follows:

**Available executables and arguments to run Core:**  
- /bin/drastic <rom> <clover_args>

**Control Mapping**  
The Nintendo DS buttons are mapped 1:1 to the SNES controller.

The hinge can be "closed" by turning off the classic with the power switch or button (it won't shut down)

Classic controller in port 1
- Move the stylus with the left analog
- Press the stylus with ZL
- Toggle full-screen with ZR

Any controller in port 2
- Move the stylus with the d-pad
- Press the stylus with A
- Toggle fullscreen with start
- Swap screens with select
- Toggle horizontal/vertical screen arrangement with B

**Configuration Menu**  
You can access the drastic configuration menu by holding the reset button for more than 1 second.

Reset button would apply to down+select shortcut, home button, reset on console, itself!

Remember, when using the Cheats HMOD for Drastic, to back out of Cheats, hold down Reset for more than 1 second, then resume game!

Personal thanks to DanTheMan827, Madmonkey, Exophase for their efforts and collaboration in this endeavor, as previously mentioned!

**MAME 2003 Plus Experimental Compatibility and Performance Update!**

This applies for Mini NES/SNES/PSC!  Personal thanks to grant2258, markwkidd, arcadez, and the rest of the team.  And, thanks arcadez, for getting some great golf games going!  Yellow and Black 1965, gingerbeardman, and Gravy are some great people who have been supportive of my efforts over the last two years.  I know all 3 of you will enjoy these fantastic gems!  The new working games for MAME 2003 Plus are:

* Golden Tee 3D Golf = gt3d
* Golden Tee Golf '97 = gt97
* Golden Tee Golf '98 = gt98
* Golden Tee Golf '99 = gt99
* Golden Tee Golf 2K = gt2k
* Golden Tee Golf Classic = gtclassc

Xtras/Arcade, _km_mame2003_plus_&_xtreme_compatibility is Updated with these and other changes that have been added over this and the last few Updates!

**Speaking of Gingerbeardman, he pinpointed a bad flaw with PCSX ReArmed, that is now mostly fixed!**

Gingerbeardman has been a great person to collaborate with over the last couple of years.  He has helped on quite a few things with his very articulate test feedback and coding prowess.  He has helped with the PSP Bios Project, fixing up FreeINT (Intellivision Core) Hit Detection Issues!  Some games, literally, had enemies that would be pushed off of the screen, without you touching them..haha:)  All good, now!  He also was able to entirely disassemble the Canoe Coding!  He has helped on some big changes for the GME Core (music format support boosts, etc), as well as np2kai, and several others!  

This time around, he was able to pinpoint a nasty bug that has plagued the PCSX ReArmed Cores for quite some time now.  The first of what might be a few fixes are implemented in this Update.  Essentially, games that have FMV Videos, and multiple audio/video files, for that matter...have a chance of desynching, and basically becoming lost and confused as far as keeping track of their proper placement.  So, what might occur in these situations would be no sound on some FMVs, other times, them being cut short.  Or, you might outright lose snippets of FMV/Audio, or have complete missing audio under certain conditions...such as with Diablo, Crash Team Racing, etc.  

Personal thanks to Gingerbeardman, as well as retro-wertz, gameblabla, and anyone else looking into this.  And, thanks to UristUriston, for feedback, as well.  This may not be a very quick fix.  But, it is being looked into and tested further...And, things should be much more solid throughout this and future Updates, with games that may have previously given you these issues!  

**Rick Dangerous Clone Added to KMFD Mod Hub!:)**

Fantastic game, that is a clone of a very early Core Design Game.  Think Indiana Jones mashed up with Pitfall, and you get the idea!  Core Design was a great, now defunct company, that made many amazing games in their years of development, such as Chuck Rock, Thunderhawk, Fighting Force, and of course, Tomb Raider!  Prerequisite is installing the XRick Core from my Set!  Have fun!  Video linked to below, that shows me running this game, awhile back!

**Many Thanks!**

Personal thanks to CompCom for doing an incredible job with RetroArch.  There were quite a few obstacles involved.  And, I commend him for nearly effortlessly jumping these hurdles.  He previously had a great hand in helping clean up some severe Save Issues with N64/GBA Games.  So many hours of testing involved on both of those fronts.  But, we stuck to it!  I had constant communication with him and a few others, who helped test...And, we pretty much arrived at a very harmonious end result, which greatly helped games like Mother 3 on GBA and Ocarina of Time on N64 finally and properly save, in-game!  These fixes are still in place, and help on all 3 Systems!  Thanks again CompCom, for being another Cog in the Great Modding Machine, that all of us may benefit from:)

I would also like to stop for a moment and thank Madmonkey, who also was a huge contributing factor in ground zero, getting the system hack up and running!  This system hack, lolhack (an inside joke:) became the base point for both Bleemsync/Autobleem, in fact!  And, also thanks to Honeylab, who helped with Mini NES/SNES/PSC, to the point of "bricking" systems, to net results we could all enjoy!

Thanks to DoctorDalek, who originated the great Internal SD Mod for the NES/SNES, as well as was a crucial part in dumping the PS Classic contents to make the hacking process all that much easier, and founded BleemSync.  

Thanks to Swingflip, for his ambition in the scene, as well.

Thanks to Defkorns, who has done some great work with Themes...which will be prominent in future Releases!  Excellent job on fully fleshing out the Theme awesomeness!   

I don't always see eye to eye with others.  We all have our goals, thoughts, beliefs, as to how things should go or be done.  I can be a bit stubborn at times.  If someone tells me something is impossible, I do my best to make it possible!  shawnsub, a good friend, and myself...have continually joked about what is impossible on the Mini.  We'd nearly always agree on impossible, but still a remote chance!  These impossibles came to full fruition, with PSP, Dreamcast, Nintendo DS, ScummVM, Amiga, even USB-HOST, and such!  Madmonkey has always been a great friend and I have learned a lot from him over the last few years I have worked with him.  It has lead to a nice Yellow Brick Road, of which many of us now benefit from!  Main case in point, I never give up, when I set my mind to something.  I set many milestone goals throughout my life, despite being told they weren't gonna be possible, or might be too difficult, or so on.  I just keep hyper-focused, til I succeed...no ands, ifs, or buts.   

Like with the Oscars, Emmys, Grammys, it is nearly impossible to thank everyone, without simply saying "everyone!"  So, thanks to everyone else, that has been a great and integral part of my Modding/Nintendo Power Project/Mad Magazine Project/Codebreaker work with Dreamcast, early Turbografx-CD work, and a whole myriad of other endeavors...You all rock!  Many of you have become lifelong friends, that I still talk to 20+ years later!    

**Really Big Thanks!**

Way back, when I was first introduced into the "hacking" world.  Some great individuals taught me some lifeskills and street knowledge that really pushed me past some seemingly impossible and insurmountable boundaries...These, including Barubary, a fantastic person who was mysterious, articulate, very cool, and learned me a lot about hacking in general.  harmony7, about Japanese Language and Culture. Codemaster, about Cheat Codes, period!  Much of this parlayed into what I have done since, regarding various Emulators, from MAME to Magic Engine to ZSNES, and so on!  Some of you might recall some of my work on various Dreamcast Games, specifically Phantasy Star Online V1/V2.  

I previously had Game Genie Experience with Galoob's add-on accessory for the original NES...which, by the way, was the cause of many of you having to needlessly "blow" your cartridges, in hopes of helping them work again!  The true problem was that the Game Genie bent the pins of your NES, on a base hardware level!  To run the games, blowing didn't help!  All you needed to do was fix the pins, or keep the Game Genie inside the system, hehe!  I used to have a nice alcohol/water/cotton swab solution, to clean cartridges, do my best to keep dust from the cartridges' exposed parts, etc!  Funny and quite ironic, to discover, when inspecting my system...that darned Game Genie is what truly mucked my systems up!  This never happened with SNES/Genesis/SMS, etc!

Codemaster showed me the nuances of using the Code Breaker for Dreamcast.  It was certainly a bit more complicated, but in a good way, than Game Genie!  

I still have a tentative plan to do a video tutorial on how to create and utilize Cheat Codes.  It is not exactly User Friendly.  But, it will be fun to show you guys and gals how to do it!  

Anecdotal Story...Barubary wanted to borrow my Serial Code for Phantasy Star Online V2, to test a security bypass check when trying to log-onto Sega's Servers.  Suffice to say, my account was banned before I "ever" played online with it:)  That being said, his 2nd attempt succeeded, and he was able to make it up to me, by using a special authorization bypass to make it past that same checkpoint, going forward.  This same scenario is partially how things work, once Official Online Servers go down.  You can have your own Server and Protocols, in which others can link together and play Online together..Think Ad-Hoc, as closely relatable in understandable terms!  It was definitely a fun time.  We were running around amok, as reskinned Sonic the Hedgehog characters, that were still in the game's "future" to be time released, coding!

Kind of like with the fiasco with DLC Characters being in a "certain" game, hehe!  And, people being charged for them, despite them already being in the game's coding! Namco certainly mocked that entire fiasco by giving all the DLC characters and levels to people for free with Tekken Tag Tournament 2, including the nifty Snoop Dogg level, that never ever gets old!

I have many other stories to tell.  But, I will save these for a rainy day:)

Now, back on track!!! 

**What did Barubary and harmony7 do that you might be aware of!?**

Well, along with a few other great individuals, such as  SoM2Freak, Y0SHi, and BiGWieRD, were directly responsible for that well known Final Fantasy 5 translation many of you might have played.  Barubary lived a few minutes away from Squaresoft headquarters in California, at the time.  That is pretty much how that all played out.  harmony7 knew Japanese, which was a tremendous asset in the whole affair!

**Closing Notes**

I will continue to Update Releases for Mini NES/SNES/PS Classic!  Thank you all for the incredible support and constant feedback.  It goes a long way, as far as helping the entire Modding Scenario consistently become better for us all!  

Did some bug fixes, improvements, and so on, Core Wise.  These are dated 3-9-19, of the ones I did not mention in the notes!  These include RetroArch 1.7.4/1.7.5 Xtreme, Caprice, all 3 MAME 2003 Cores!...mGBA, sameboy, theodore, vbam, FBA 2018, 

I will do several follow-up Videos and Tutorials showcasing other things you can do with PS Classic!

In the future, many Updates will be more optimal for PS Classic.  I will notate the differences on each of the Systems, related to any and all changes!  Hope you enjoy the Release!  

Hello, hope you all get to enjoy the fantastic PS Classic Xtreme Core Set Release!  This is especially meant to 
be for those who have been enjoying my Mini NES/SNES Release for the last 2 years+  I did what I could to make
the transition as easy and optimal and awesome as possible!

C2, C3, C4, C5, C7, C8 errors will not prompt on screen.
Instead, your system will simply and gracefully shut down! (PS Classic)

Personal thanks to CompCom, Swingflip, DoctorDalek, Yannick, screemerpl, and everyone else for their efforts in the PS Classic Scene!  Things will continue to get better and better, without a doubt!

Sincerely, KMFDManic!!!

P.S.  Now that this Release is done, I will prioritize getting some more Drumming into some fun videos, for you all to enjoy!  Maybe, more of the Cat, too!

**Ahh, Hell, why not, here are some previous Drum Videos I have done...!  Enjoy!:)**

**Drum Mode Activate!**

A little rough around the edges, as some of these were my very first attempts!  But, I never Edit the fun stuff out!

Signing out, officially!  Enjoy the friggin' Update!!!

**3-5-19**

Thanks for the overwhelming support, feedback, and such concerning the last two Updates!  Ladies and Gentlemen, Start Your Engines, and Mark Your Calendars!  A few things will be tweaked, fixed, and Updated on Saturday, 3-9-19!  See you then:)  

**3-2-19**

**First one of the year, congrats to:**

**nexxusty**
Get some speech therapy dude.... how can you live like that??

**Kyland K AKA KMFDManic**

I normally don't bother with non-descript comments, such as yours, that offer no real contribution to society.  But, I will give you the benefit of the doubt here.  Maybe, just maybe, you have learned some real morality from your mother or grandmother or sister, or someone else for that matter...And, maybe, one day, you will better respect the distinctive differences of individuality that we all have:)  I live my life, just fine, and have many friends that honestly don't give a flying rat's ass how I look, act, walk, talk, and all that jazz.  Comments like yours come rarely, and are of zero consequence to me.  I wish you the best, and hope you get to better enjoy your Mini experience, and better tolerate people that you might realize could be truly kick-ass friends:)?

**3-1-19**

**NOTE: Main Release Download is way at bottom of this page, now.  It used to always be on top!  Just so you all know:)  You can use the alternate links, as well!**

DraStic is back bigger, badder, and better than ever...fixed, and Full On Cheat Support, as well as High Definition Mode Activate!  Most games will run fine in HD, now!  There were issues in the earlier builds that were able to be resolved.  What would happen before was games would randomly lock up memory, and completely freeze to a standstill!  Now, instead, you will just get occasional slowdown on more cpu/gpu intensive moments in some games!  Enjoy HD Nintendo DS Games, and the choice of Standard (13.1 MB) and Xtreme (36 MB) Cheats HMODs.  Remember, only one can be installed at a time!  Mario Kart runs absolutely fantastic now!  

Screen Rotation, Microphone Oriented Games that require Mic Checks, and Slash Controls are still notable issues not yet resolved...for the record.  Do not expect any of these 3 to be immediately fixed.  But, we do have potential means, although things might be tricky, due to the closed code...to pull this stuff off.  Let's just hope!  

Two Videos linked to below, showcasing both HD and Cheats in action!

Personal thanks to the many people who have offered to help and test the fixes since last night!

Thank you, LonerGuy85, who gave up sleep to help test while I was at work! And, huge thanks to nl255 and DeadSkullzJr, as well, for their collaborative efforts with Cheats! And, of course to Exophase, Madmonkey, DanTheMan827 for their roles in helping get this off the ground and becoming a reality for us all!

RetroArch Xtreme 1.7.4/1.7.5 (Fceumm) is the ONLY other thing Updated, with a sound fix to make NES games sound even more authentic to the real hardware!  Personal thanks to JV1986 for his test feedback, making this easier for me to get fixed up!

You can right click and set emulation core with Hakchi2 CE 3.5.2, or manually amend command line, first part, to be /bin/fceumm to take advantage of the sound fixes.  Also enjoy the minimal to no slowdown fixes from previous Updates, especially with games like Contra Force...which were nearly and absolutely unplayable on the real hardware, in fact!

Due to popular request, I will work on getting Multi Disk Video Tutorial posted, as well as look into fixing up a few more stubborn Cores, that have slowdown issues.  And, those who have asked about Sega Saturn.  Our only ways of getting it to run better are to fix Dynamic Recompiler with Yabause and/or get Kronos running!  So, just be patient, and hopefully either/or/both will work out in the near future!  We all most certainly need our Panzer Dragoon/Shining Force III, Shinobi Legions, and so on...fixes, without a doubt!

And, I appreciate all the User Requests to do more drumming videos!  I will work those in, worry not!

And, lastly, of course...there is still much magic to come with the PS Classic, as well as both Mini NES/SNES!  I will follow-up on suggestions, comments, messages...regarding anything, otherwise:)

Here we are, yet again, for another Release!  Too many fun things to hold back for long.  So, I have decided to unleash them for your perusal and enjoyment.  Hopefully, you all get some time to play around with these over the Weekend!

Bullet Points, Release Notes, Videos, Closing Statement...Here We Go Again!:)

- Canoe Purists, DarkAkuma works his magic!
- Hakchi2 CE is still being worked on!  What do you want added!?
- Nintendo DS even better:  DraStic Updated with Cheats Support!
- For slightly more Advanced Nintendo DS Users, Save Checksum Bypass!
- For even more Advanced Nintendo DS Users, Slot2 Support!
- More awesomeness added to the KMFD Mod Hub Games Tab!
- Hasta La Vista Baby! MAME 2003 Plus Experimental Updated!
- FBA 2018 Updated!
- Pesky Pole Position control issues No More!
- Sega Genesis Slowdown Be Gone!
- Ah!  The Videos!
- Lastly!

**Canoe Purists, DarkAkuma works his magic!**

Those of you who so choose to run any or all of the SNES games with the default Canoe Emulator, be sure to check out:

http://darkakuma.z-net.us/p/sfromtool.html

You can use the sfromtool along with Hakchi, and go to the patches section on the link above, to account for a multitude of games!  Great work, as always, DarkAkuma!

In other news, he has gained a more fundamental and deeper understanding of how the PCM format works, which will help him know what the data is, make improvements, and make coding additions to the existing tools for the better!  Very impressive!  

**Hakchi2 CE is still being worked on!  What do you want added!?**

Several have voiced concerns over Hakchi not being updated, of late.  You can be rest assured it is still being actively worked on.  DanTheMan827 will be implementing fixes for DOS Saves, and several other potential and very interesting additions.  We ask you now, what do "you" want to see added?  As long as it is a reasonable request, we can look into it!  We are still ironing out potential details of possible, but, likely limited PS Classic Support.  Much like kachikachi for NES Classic and Canoe for SNES Classic, Ideally...the main and primary focus of importance would be the "default" PCSX ReArmed, in conjunction with the yet unreleased PSpwned.  I have already showcased this combination in a previous video.  It works extremely well, in fact.  And, I would love to see this fully realized, if all works out.  

There are, of course, other modifications out in the wild, for the PS Classic...including BleemSync (a play on an early commercially sold PS1 Emulator!), which Pat Hartl works with on a regular basis...as well as AutoBleem, which screemerpl updates.  Each of them has their own perks and merits, and will just take patience and time to come to full fruition...like all things do.  Those who work on both of these are fully aware of issues as they arise, and do their best to quickly resolve them.  It is best recommended to refrain from expressing any frustration and anger over something that is still essentially in its early stages, modification wise, and not yet fully understood on a base level.  Patience is a very strong virtue when it comes to this sort of thing.  And, there will always be inherent risks anytime you circumvent the default way a system is meant to run.  Give it a little time, and things will continue to look better and better.  In the words of a great 1980s song, slightly altered to correlate to this scenario, "The future's so bright, you gotta wear shades!"  

For now, go with the flow, and voice your wishes, wants, and desires, as far as what you would like to see within the context of the next Hakchi Release!  And, of course, a huge appreciation goes out to DanTheMan827 for continuing the Legacy of Hakchi, and not letting it fall off the wayside!

**Nintendo DS even better:  DraStic Updated with Cheats Support!**

We now have Full On Cheat Mode Activate Support with the Nintendo DS DraStic Core! 

Personal thanks to Exophase, Madmonkey, DanTheMan827, DeadSkullzJr, nl255 for their help in making the DraStic Experience better!  And, Thank You! LonerGuy85 for continually sending me funny, random messages, such as, "DraStic Cheats!...DraStic Cheats!...DraStic Cheats!...DraStic Cheats!(screaming loudly with picket sign):rofl:""  Haha:)  We can now enjoy them now, thanks to the amazing collaboration and work of myself and everyone else involved!

This has been oft requested.  Myself and nl255 finally had some time to look into this, and fix things up.  You will now be able to run a crazy amount of Cheat Codes with DraStic!  I have put together 2 Cheat HMODs for this very purpose.  One, the DraStic Cheats Standard Edition, is 13.1 MB.  The other, the DraStic Cheats Xtreme Edition, is 36 MB.  The reason for this is to give you all the choice of how to best utilize your precious NAND internal memory!  You can only have one of these installed at a time.  So, be sure to choose the one that best suits your playstyle...Casual and do not need every single Cheat possible...or, hardcore, and "gotta catch em all!"  For most Users, Standard will be more than sufficient.  Just keep that in mind!

**For slightly more Advanced Nintendo DS Users, Save Checksum Bypass!**

With DraStic and either Cheats HMOD installed, you can do an exploit to "save checksum bypass", wherein, you would use a save from DeSmuME on DraStic, and vice versa!  You have to first go in-game, enable the cheat, exit the game, transfer the save file, then reenter the game to utilize the magic!  You will be able to do it for Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow and Final Fantasy III, amongst a few others detailed in the DraStic Cheats HMODs!  Be sure to back up your previous save, because it will be deleted if you do not follow this process to the T!

**For even more Advanced Nintendo DS Users, Slot2 Support!**

Check back on these Release Notes over the next several days, as I should have time to post a WIP Slot2 Support Video Tutorial to help many of you get the rare ring for Dawn of Sorrow, as well as trade or transfer Pokemon, and so on!  I will Update this portion of the Notes, and/or post a video!  Personal thanks to nl255 for his helpful test support on this great addition!  This is for more Advanced Users, as it will require a special workaround to pull off for now.  But, we may code in an alternative method of doing it, which is more User Friendly!  Be sure to check back! 

**More awesomeness added to the KMFD Mod Hub Games Tab!**

I have never gone out of my way to soul search for homebrew or hacks in general.  But, some just really stand out as awesome, such as Battle Kid and Zelda Outlands are perfect examples of great games that get my attention.  I added some homebrew in previous releases.  Three more great ones get added, this time around!

Both of Gradual Games' gems, Nomolos: Storming the Catstle (a sidescrolling actioner) and The Legends of Owlia (a nifty Zelda inspired affair with a cool and clever gimmick...an owl companion/weapon of sorts).  Huge thanks to the individuals at Gradual Games for making these possible!

And, then we have Warhawk for DS, a great homebrew remake of an original C64 game from many years back.  Huge thanks to Headgames, who did a tremendous job on this!

All 3 are in Games Tab in KMFD Mod Hub!  Huge thanks to Dank Games, who also has a great channel at:

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6fMrosRBLvaV3imogXjUg

for turning me onto the greatness of The Legends of Owlia!  Great stuff, man!  Anyone else who has any amazing homebrew to recommend for the masses to enjoy, definitely suggest away!

 **Hasta La Vista Baby! MAME 2003 Plus Experimental Updated!**

Install the latest MAME 2003 Plus Experimental and RetroArch Xtreme combination to enjoy more fully realized games, such as Terminator 2, of which I did a video tutorial of below!  

You can, also, right click in Hakchi2 CE, and set Emulation Core for MAME 2003 Plus, and it will work with the Current Release:)  For MAME 2003 Xtreme, simply right click, and select MAME 2003 in Hakchi!  Just make sure the MAME 2003 and other Cores are from my Set, to avoid conflicts!  I have them all harmoniously set-up to run in tandem with one another!  Plus, Standard, and Xtreme!

**FBA 2018 Updated!**

Install the latest FBA 2018 and RetroArch Xtreme to additionally enjoy some amazing games, such as Zero Team, Metamoqester, Asura Blade and Asura Buster!  Huge thanks to EWPhis47x for giving me a refresher course on these games which I had not played for quite some time.  FBA 2018 demands we play and enjoy them, without a doubt!

**Pesky Pole Position control issues No More!**

Update latest MAME 2003 Xtreme and RetroArch Xtreme, and you can run Pole Position with B for Brake, A for Accelerate, and Up on D Pad to Gear Shift!  This will be quite convenient for those on NES/SNES, and otherwise, tougher to work with controllers!  

If any of you have any other pesky control issues, be it Ikari Warriors, etc, feel free to request I fix them up for a future Release, and I will do my best to do so!  

**Sega Genesis Slowdown Be Gone!**

Much like the NES Fixes, Sega Genesis has been fixed up, as well!  Games that previously had slowdown issues, such as Sonic Spinball, Road Rash, WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game, Grind Stormer, Alien Storm, and countless others...now have minimal to no slowdown!  Install latest Genesis Plus GX and/or PicoDrive, along with RetroArch Xtreme, and you will be good to go!  

The base point for testing these changes was Sparkster...which, like BattleToads on the NES changes...was sensitive to certain things...We are all good to go now!  

I will look into fixing up other Cores, as well!  Just don't expect miracles with Sega Saturn, Atari Jaguar, 3DO, etc!    

**Ah!  The Videos!**

Cores that have been Updated this Release are: Caprice32, DraStic, Final Burn Alpha 2018, Genesis Plus GX,  MAME 2003 Plus Experimental and Xtreme, Mednafen SuperGrafx, mGBA, PicoDrive, PrBoom, RetroArch Xtreme 1.7.4/1.75, Theodore, and VirtualJaguar, and are all dated 2-28-19!

I will still get up another few Tutorials and videos and such throughout the next week!

**Enjoy the Update**

Sincerely, KMFDManic!

**2-23-19**

**Those who have had trouble finding the link to the download...it is way at the bottom of the page.  Hopefully, next Release, it will appropriately be at the top!  Sorry for any inconvenience!**

**Update is dated 2-18-19!**

Welcome back everyone!  Sorry for the delayed Release.  Have been a bit sick over the last several weeks.  There were also some last minute bug fixes and additions I really wanted to get into place.  Due to the Xtreme nature of some of the changes, some things needed completely overhauled!  In any case, many more fun things to play around with this Update!  As per usual, bullet points, then Notes, Videos (Be sure to check back on my YouTube Channel, as some videos will post after this Release!), Closing Comments!  For those who are not into wall of texts and the open world awesomeness of what each Core Set release offers, you are more than welcome to go onto Amazon or Ebay, and pick up one of those great ATGames systems, and take a few steps back, simplifying the entire experience! Otherwise, everyone else, enjoy!  And, as always,   As always, huge thanks to DanTheMan827 and madmonkey for their efforts in the scene, that have truly helped pushed us beyond quite a few seemingly impossible boundaries for the Mini Classics!  I would also like to give a personal shout-out to Twinaphex for all of his devotion!  Hope you find time to enjoy the Custom OSTs!

- First rule of Mod Club!
- SNES9x 2016 fixed!
- Introducing SNES9x 2018!
- Speaking of SNES, How about some Elite, Must Have Ogre Battle Cheats!?
- How about even "more" handy Cheats for SNES Final Fantasy II & GBA Golden Sun!?
- Donkey Kong & Donkey Kong Jr FTW!

**Now then:)**

**First rule of Mod Club!**

What is the single most important thing relative to Mod Club?  Well, that would be BIOS, the set of instructions that runs the hardware the games even play on!  Many Cores will not even properly emulate or function without said BIOS!  Remember, there is a very handy BIOS printable pdf in Xtras/BIOS, courtesy of justme488, Antifly, and myself!  Now, you can have a much easier and more convenient way to know exactly what is needed to get things up and running, Core wise!  Examples of Cores that will go absolutely nowhere without BIOS are Genesis Plus GX (Mega and Sega CD), fMSX (MSX) and BlueMSX (MSX and ColecoVision),  PCE-Fast (Turbografx-CD).  The pdf will be Updated more within the next few Releases.  There is also an additional BIOS Text File I have put together to help with a few other nuances.  These will both change accordingly in the near future to be more adaptive to any incoming and upcoming changes!  

Some Cores have "Optional" BIOS, such as PCSX ReArmed NEON.  But, I absolutely recommend using BIOS for ones like these.  PCSX has a multitude of games that will crash or simply not work correctly without BIOS implementation.  And, even mGBA, which does not require BIOS, has better sound if you do use BIOS.  So, if ever in doubt, use the BIOS anyways!  Again, these BIOS are are detailed within the Master BIOS Module, whilst viewed directly in Modules Install/Uninstall Tab (upon copying said Module there, of course!), as well as in Xtras/BIOS in a printable file and additional BIOS ReadMe!

If any of you ever have any question about BIOS, feel free to ask!  MAME in particular can be quite confusing when it comes to BIOS, from NEO-GEO to Polygame Master to CPS2 and Konami GX!  Don't be afraid to ask!  I will do my best to put you on the right path.

**SNES9x 2016 fixed!**

It happens occasionally due to various reasons.  Sometimes it can be a "butterly effect", wherein a change for one platform breaks another.  But, when it does happen, I do my best to get it resolved.  Last Release, SNES9x 2016 had a regression with performance, that is now fixed with this Release!  Thanks to Ruby Eye Shabrangidu and FokinoPelvis, and  AntiFly for bringing this to my attention!  All good, fine and dandy, now:)  Sorry for any inconvenience!  Remember, if any you do discover bugs like this, you can let me know and I will look into it.  

**Introducing SNES9x 2018!**

SNES9x 2018 is based off of the upstream code base, which is predominantly within the year of 2018.  For those of you not familiar with Upstream and Downstream.  It typically involves Upstream catering to the PC side of things, and Downstream being any number of other such platforms, in addition to PC!  This leads to a lot of fun, of course!  In testing, there are enough variable differences (Mini Wise to warrant a branching path, much akin to that of FBA 2016/2018.  2016 is 1.57; 2018 is 1.58.  This may change in future Releases.  But, for now, the command lines for the SNES Cores, if using more than one...are now:

/bin/snes02 , /bin/snes05 , /bin/snes10 , /bin/snes16 , /bin/snes9x-bright , and /bin/snes18  

I try to maintain a fine median between Upstream/Downstream in the overall Core Set, so that we can have as great Performance/Speed as possible with our relatively low spec hardware.  Not every Downstream change would be applicable to our platforms.  And, I take this into account.

Some fixes that apply to 1.57 and 1.58 include:

Various seta010 emulation fixes (kps501), Pass blargg OAM tests with proper write behavior (BearOso), Prevent interlacing in BG modes 1-4 (BearOso), Corrected IRQ and NMI emulation to allow more games to work properly                                            (BearOso, OV2), Use 1 instead of 0 for initial PPU left window coordinate, fixing garbage in left column of pixels in some games (turhope), Added interpolation option hack for DSP (kps501, mudlord, BearOso), Added sprite-tile limit disabling hack (Tatsuya79), Added libretro's fast snapshot support (OV2), Add overclocking hack that increases IPC (retrotalker), Proper write behavior for register $2122 (BearOso), Fix controller initialization issues preventing some games from using multitap (retrotalker),  Increase SuperFX speed to more accurately represent hardware, and fix bugs with Stunt Race FX and Yoshi's Island (BearOso)   Fix transparency issue with Star Fox asteroids (redguy, BearOso), Resize viewport on state load (retrotalker),  Many fixes to variables not saved or saved incorrectly in save states (Dwedit), Pass decimal tests in blargg's math test ROMs (BearOso), Remove memory leak in loadzip.cpp (bonimy), Fix screen size not reverting when overscan is turned on then off mid-frame (BearOso)                  

Due to the Butterfly Mod Effect, where any one change can affect something else, in combination with general overall compatibility...this is why I also maintain Final Burn Alpha 2016/2018  Quite a few people have been gracious enough to help with testing, and helping determine some games benefited being run on one versus the other!  Personal thanks, again, to Ruby Eye Shabrangidu and FokinoPelvis, AntiFly, Jul Car, and everyone else that has been so amazing in helping test SNES9x and FBA coding changes!

MSU-1 Support is also better optimized with SNES9x 2018  MSU-1 works with SNES9x 2016, SNES9x 2016-Bright, and SNES9x 2018.  When used along with RetroArch Xtreme, you will get better results on some of the more stubborn games.  Remember, some games are cpu/gpu intensive by nature.  These same games, would run better on the less accurate SNES9x 2005 Cores, non-MSU-1 wise.  2018 is about as good as you will get, currently, for MSU-1.  Try out Super R-Type, which runs phenomenally with it!  I showcase it in one of the Irem Videos linked to!  

It might not always be abundantly clear.  But, quite a bit goes into each and every Core, whether it emulates Atari 2600 (Stella) or SNES (SNES9x), Upstream and Downstream!  
   
**Speaking of SNES, How about some Elite, Must Have Ogre Battle Cheats!?**

Someone, who wishes to remain anonymous, brought to me a truly excellent anecdotal dilemma.

"I have been spending countless hours playing this game that I purchased as a kid with the goal of obtaining the best ending. Over 20+ hours into the game, I realized I sold an item that I shouldn't have... the "Mercury" which also goes by the name "Silver" in the actual game inventory. This screwed me out of my best ending and there is no way to get it back"

As a result, I have now added a very special, Must Have, Ogre Battle Action Replay Cheats for Elitists, in the latest 
_km_retroarch_cheats_snes HMOD!   Personal thanks to CouchPotato, as well, for the many hours of love and devotion he has poured into helping better the Ogre Battle experience for us all!  Enjoy, and Happy RPG Gaming!

**How about even "more" handy Cheats for SNES Final Fantasy II & GBA Golden Sun!?**

Some Nifty Game Genie Codes for both Final Fantasy II for SNES, and Golden Sun for GBA, including:

 Final Fantasy II; 5 Per Item After Battle, Every Battle Rewards You With A Treasure Chest, Monsters Drop Rarest Treasure After Battle, No Random Encounters, Random Battle With Rarest Enemy In Area, Unlimited Gold, & Unlimited Health!

Golden Sun: Max Money & No Random Battles

Personal thanks to pakicito, TheTrain, LiteralWarCriminal for testing...And, of course anyone who has worked
on any of these cheats originally! 

**I don't think we have enough Cheats!  Let's also add some Nintendo DS (DeSmuME, Not-DraStic!)**

Many of you may have realized by now that DraStic Cheats do not function properly.  This is still loosely on the overall agenda to fix up.  But, in the meantime, I offer you up some NDS (Nintendo DS Cheats) for use with DeSmuMe!  Tetris DS is one of many games that plays decently enough in conjunction with RetroArch Xtreme to warrant potentially wanting to run on DeSmuMe instead of DraStic, to utilize some of the fun cheats!  There is a general compatibility list in Xtras/DS that are a result of testing of Butter_Spill, Rockmangames & Myself.  

Additionally, some of the games that "Do Not" work on DraStic, such as Princess Peach, do work on DeSmuME.  So, that is food for thought.  Faster games without Cheats; Slower games with Cheats...with some games that do not, at all, work with DraStic!  Princess Peach, of course, does not work because it fails the microphone check...of which DraStic cannot currently support.  

One thing to mention is, it is best recommended to run one DS game at a time with DeSmuME.  Like with N64, PSP, Dreamcast, Sega Saturn...if running via _DUMMY Folder Method, memory can potentially lock up and freeze, if you load too many games in succession.  From Main UI, things are fine.  But, from _DUMMY Folder, best to completely quit RetroArch, then reopen...otherwise, you might land a C7 error or other instabilities.  These are the main ones affected by this minor issue.

**And, then, how about some ZX Spectrum Cheats, as well!**

Also a fun, well received computer, with a whole myriad of great games to check out, including Rick Dangerous and countless Licensed Games you would be more likely see on PCs at that time frame, than on home consoles, such as NES!  

**Why not, let's overhaul ALL Cheats!**

All Cheats have been updated, accordingly.  Several broken ones were removed and otherwise replaced...others updated for the better, new ones added, as well!  Remember, some Cheats are more attuned to running with RetroArch 1.7.5 Xtreme, than with previous RetroArchs.  There were quite a few bugs fixed, relative to Cheats.

This also goes for ALL Custom Cheats, in Xtras/Cheats, for those who want a more personal handle on adding your own codes!  As always, if any of you can think of something that would benefit everyone, feel free to let me know...and, I will try to implement them in a future Release.  Ogre Battle and Golden Sun Cheats were most welcome, this time around!  

**Donkey Kong & Donkey Kong Jr FTW!**

Two of the games most commonly associated with people having difficulty running properly, are none other than Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr.!  One of the reasons for this is due to the fact that the sound cores have not fully been emulated.  This is common for quite a few games.  But, these are the two most prominent examples.  With the combination of RetroArch Xtreme in conjunction with MAME 2003 Xtreme and/or MAME 2003 Plus and/or FBA 2016 and/or FBA 2018 Combinations, you will now have about as close to the arcade Donkey Kong + Donkey Kong Jr. sound experience as one could ever hope to have!  Personal thanks to Derrick Renaud and Peter Rittwage for their time and efforts into fine-tuning these non easy to work with game sounds to near perfection!

Mario Bros. is also accounted for with same as above!  Any other stubborn games, may be potentially done directly, sound core wise, in future Updates!

**MAME 2003 Plus even better with implementation of Analog Controls!**

This is one of the happiest changes I have added to the set.  This was an idea that came near simultaneously from markwkidd and myself.  What many of you do not realize is, to best summarize things...Think the Playstation Classic, and having Metal Gear Solid.  This is a game clearly designed to work and be optimal for Analog Controllers!  Yet, the controllers that come with the Mini PS Classic do not contain Analog Sticks!  You are essentially playing a game in an off-kilter digital d-pad respect, instead of the way it was intended to be played!

This goes for many Arcade Games, with MAME.  They are meant to be analog, yet set-up under an odd d-pad'esque style of control.  One particular game that pet peeved me for the longest time, with this issue, had been my beloved Hard Drivin'.  I absolutely love this game, and it is a permanent mainstay for me on Sega Genesis AKA Mega Drive!  

It was a beautiful thing indeed for grant2258 to take more than a passing interest in this challenge.  As a result, with this latest Update for MAME 2003 Plus...you can now go into RetroArch Settings, Input, change to Legacy...and utilize analog support!  What good is analog, you might ask?  Well, try out Star Wars Arcade, the Vector Game, which was near previously unplayable due to the reticle being far too finicky and seemingly oversensitive.  With analog enabled, you have more finesse, clearly defined and precise movements, and the game is a much grander thing to play, as a whole.  
  
  This also applies to the Vs. Nintendo Gun games, such as Duck Hunt!  You can still tweak the mouse sensitivity, case by case!  So, enjoy a whole multitude of light gun, racing, etc, games...with an excellent, quite workable analog support!  Thanks again, grant2258 and markwkidd!  

**MAME 2003 Plus Duck Hunt & Other Light Gun Games with a controller!**

As per above, you can more optimally play Duck Hunt & many other Light Gun Games with a controller!  If you've attempted to run Duck Hunt before, as an example...you would have seen it was nearly impossible to play due to its insane insensitivity and frustrating controls!  No more, as it is far more playable than ever before:)  It is now on par with playing the Adventures of Bayou Billy Light Gun stages on the original NES!  Videos below show this in action, as well as the appropriate way to set things up!  Now, we just need to get a controller working for some of the Nintendo Vs. Variant games on one of the NES Cores, such as Fceumm, Nestopia, or even QuickNES!  For now, enjoy Vs. Duck Hunt, Vs. Freedom Force, Vs. Gumshoe, and Vs. Hogan's Alley, amongst many other games, 

You will need RetroArch Xtreme and MAME 2003 Plus Experimental installed.  Then, go to Core Options, temporarily enable MAME Menu.  Remember, MAME Menu needs toggled on/off when in use or not in use.  It doesn't work the same way as MAME 2003 Xtreme, where you can use R2 to quickly access it.  But, this has a bonus perk.  Those on NES/SNES Controllers need only use the select+start shortcut to access RetroArch Settings, then can easily turn MAME Menu On/Off!  Nice workaround for those that are controller challenged!  In any case, once in MAME Menu, go to "analog controls", then refine all numbers to 15-20.  Duck Hunt is a little more sensitive, so works optimally at 15-18 as the overall sensitivity.  Games like Hogan's Alley work better at roughly 18-20.  I have tested a multitude of games.  And, this truly is the closest thing to running an experience much akin to the original and very fun Light Gun stages in The Adventures of Bayou Billy!

  As a last minute addition, you will also now be able to finally play the great Gun games Dragon Gun (Data East) and Space Gun (Taito) and Zombie Raid (American Sammy)!  Thanks to EWPhis47x for recommending I look into these two, specifically.  Both truly excellent games and definitely worthy of a play or few!  Also, personal thanks to Grant2258, markwkidd, arcadez, and the rest of the amazing MAME Team who have helped make this become a reality.  Again, this directly correlates to the above notation about "MAME 2003 Plus even better with implementation of Analog Controls!"  Gotta love the Butterfly Mod Effect!  Speaking of which!

**Butterfly Mod Effect: NES Game Slowdown Be Gone!**

The Butterfly Mod Effect is a playful reference to the fun movie with Ashton Kutcher, wherein every little change can have an equal and opposite reaction, good or bad.  In this case, fixing one thing can lead to breaking another...or, helping lead to fixing yet another!  It is always fun and games, and quite a bit of semantics at work!  SNES9x 2016 was broken last update due to another fix.  This is now rectified, and all is good now!  I also separated the base coding from the last stable 2016 to current 2018-2019 coding, and we now have SNES9x 2018 from Upstream!  In any case, Druid for the Famicom Disk System, was fixed in the "last" Update, with the great efforts of retro-wertz and also Zepper and rainwarrior.  The IRQ timing was off and caused flickering menus, which made the game virtually unplayable.  

That being said, Who needs slowdown in this day or age...?  Been there, done that:)  I have decided to try something different and just rid of it, altogether.  I have been having a great deal of fun enjoying these masterpieces in a new light, without needing to "blow cartridges", so to speak, nor drudge through incredibly inundated slowdown, to boot!

With an interesting and delicate balancing of timing fixes and the Mod Butterfly Effect, we get minimal to no slowdown for NES games!  Due to how absolutely precise the timing is for games like BattleToads, I had to very carefully deploy how this was done, to not break things.  I was able to fully play and beat BattleToads, and maintain these fixes!

So now, you can truly enjoy games that are typically synonymous and plagued by slowdown, such as the number one contender, Contra Force!  And, also ones like Kirby's Adventure, Mega Man 2, Gradius, TMNT, Lifeforce, and so on!  Simply have RetroArch Xtreme installed, and run with /bin/fceumm  Stubborn games, such as Micro Machines, and such, should still be run with /bin/nestopia  If you want to be more of a purist and masochist, you can still enjoy slowdown with /bin/quicknes All 3 NES Cores are fantastic, and I wouldn't run without any of the above.  They all have their perks.

**Speaking of NES, how about better sound and colors!?**

One thing that slightly perturbed me and a few others over the course of the last 2 years was the distinctive difference between kachikachi, the default NES Emulator on the NES Classic...and, the coloring on the various NES Cores.  Myself and many others have become very acclimated to the solid offering of authentic look of the games when running with kachikachi.  Now, when you run ANY of the 3 NES Cores in this current Update, they will all have the more authentic kachikachi appearance.  Again, /bin/fceumm  /bin/nestopia  /bin/quicknes

Additionally, a few have mentioned sound wasn't exactly crisp and true to the original system.  Some adjustments have been made for pitch and bit rate to allow for a closer to the original experience, especially with /bin/fceumm

**NES again, who loves homebrew?  Who loves action-rpgs!?**

I have added a beautiful beta for Mystic Searches, a fantastic upcoming game that will be even be able to be purchased on real cartridge, in fact, at:

http://austinmckinley.com/8bit/the-shop.html

Mystic Origins Beta is approximately 1/10th of the final product, and truly shows how amazing homebrew can be when done right!  The entire game was made by The 8 Bit Heroes, utilizing tools they put forth in a program called NESmaker.  This nifty program can make games using assets that can be run on real flashed cartridges, as well as on emulators, such as on the Mini Classics!  

It is on KMFD Mod Hub, under Games Tab!  

**MAME 2003 Plus Artwork HMOD 12 MB smaller!**

Not everyone uses USB-HOST.  So, I have done some work and tweaking to make the overall size of the HMOD for the MAME 2003 Plus Artwork roughly 12 MB smaller!  Definitely nice for NAND users!  I will continue to do more with this in future Updates.

**MAME 2003 Plus Artwork HMOD Commando fixed!**

Commando Artwork was upside down, and also set-up for a game variant that does not work, due to encryption.  I have personally fixed it so it is right side up and will now work with the clone commandu.zip  So, do not use commando.zip to run the game.  It works fantastic with commandu.zip !  Speaking of!

**MAME 2003 Xtreme Updated with a vengeance!**

Many changes have gone into the latest MAME 2003 Xtreme Update, including a very special video refresh calculation check to ensure games appropriately play at the expected refresh rate!  What does this mean?  Nearly every conceivable game that previously had issues, such as Midway/Bally (Journey, Tapper, Rampage, etc.)  You can read the list in Xtras/Arcade/, , RoboCop, countless others...now play near flawlessly, right off the bat!  Personal thanks to some feedback test results of EWPhis47x and DRVR 99, helping me decide on a proper path for Xtreme, for the better. 

**Performance Boost for Taito F3 Games with MAME 2003 Xtreme!**

With the advent of this latest Update, manipulation was more optimally possible to fix up nearly the entire subset of Taito F3 Games to be far more playable than ever before!  Don't expect miracles, obviously, being these are PS1/Sega Saturn Tier Level Games!  But, they are much more approachable and fun to play!  You will need RetroArch Xtreme and MAME 2003 Xtreme to best enjoy them!  Taito F3 Games that are accounted for are:

(NOTE: some of these may have control or start issues)

Arabian Magic (Fantastic gem of a sidescrolling hack and slash brawler!)
Arkanoid Returns
Bubble Memories
Bubble Symphony / Bubble Bobble 2

Top Ranking Stars

**MAME 2003 Xtreme doesn't stop there...How about SSV Hardware Sound Fixes!?**

Some of these games had grating like nails on chalkboard sound glitches.  Personal thanks to grant2258, markwkidd, and arcadez for helping fix things up, in this respect!  Some games that benefit from the much better and improved and fixed sound, include:

(NOTE: some of these may have control or start issues)

Change Air Blade (Very cool SHMUP!)

**How about even MORE MAME 2003 Xtreme Irem Sound Fixes and Improvements!?**

The final set of Irem Sound Improvement Fixes have been put into place, making 99.5 percent of the Irem Catalog sound crystal clear and a hell of a lot closer to the Arcade Originals!  Dragon Breed is one of my personal favorites that really gets a nice sound upgrade!  The only game still having some minor issues is still Ninja Baseball Batman, which still runs better than in previous Updates!  Thanks grant2258, markwkidd, arcadez, and the rest of the team for the help on this one!

**And, of course, Vector Game enhancements and fixes for MAME 2003 Xtreme!**

Vector Games have never looked or played better than they currently do in this Release.  Huge thanks to the MAME 2003 Team for helping on this one.  Try Tempest for a truly beautiful experience!  If you want to really go all out, go into RetroArch Video Settings, and enable bilinear filtering...specifically for this subset of games.  Be sure to turn it back off before exiting.  It won't do games like Marvel Vs Capcom justice.  But, it truly benefits Vector Games!  Note: MOST of the following have had issues in the past.  But, nearly all of them are fixed now!  Be sure to run Star Wars Arcade on MAME 2003 Plus, however.  I am still testing implementation of the fix, avoiding any nasty side effects, for MAME 2003 Xtreme!)

**PPSSPP Updated for Dual Xtreme/Standard Usage!**

PPSSPP Xtreme Mode Activate - /bin/ppsspp

PPSSPP Standard Mode Activate - /bin/ppsspp-standard

For most users, PPSSPP Xtreme is all one will ever need.   If you just have PPSSPP Xtreme installed, you will only need to use /bin/ppsspp  If Standard, then /bin/ppsspp-standard  For most users, PPSSPP Xtreme will be all one 
ever needs.  But, there are a select few special circumstances where having dual usage of PPSSPP Xtreme and Standard allows more finesse with some stubborn games!  As a result, they are now set up for dual usage, much like the previous Dual Canoe SNES (which has since been recoded to be more harmonious with Canoe/SNES9x dual usage!) and so on.  Personal thanks to Ignacio Aldazabal for helping with PSP stress tests.

Xtreme Mode has higher compatibility and better accuracy.  But, some games that are stubborn, work better with Standard Mode!

In Xtreme Mode, defaults are absolutely required to be auto frame skip OFF, and at 0, ONLY.  The ONLY thing you can safely change is frame skip between 0-1.  Otherwise, you may encounter flickering or black screen for games!  To exit games, simply exit like any other Core, with RetroArch Exit or Controller Shortcut.  It may take up several seconds to exit, so be patient!

Xtreme Mode also allows _DUMMY Folder Method without first running from Main UI!

In Standard Mode, you can have auto frame skip on or off, and use frame skip anywhere from 0-9!  You will need to make absolute sure you set auto frame skip back to OFF, and frame skip to 0, before utilizing Xtreme Mode again!  Or, you will encounter graphical glitches.  To exit games, you can Load 2048 or Mr.Boom Cores, Start either/or, then exit safely!

You are required to run the initial game from Main UI when using Standard Mode!

It is not, at all, recommended to shut down your Mini, after exiting a PSP game.  It uses quite a bit of memory, and you will have high probability of running into a C8 error.  Load up any other game, THEN shutdown to minimize chance of C8.

NOTE: PPSSPP uses 256+ MB memory, so only load 1 game at a time! 
Exit back to the main UI before attempting to load another.  Otherwise, you 
will very likely freeze RetroArch by maxing out and locking up said memory. Exiting
should be done normally, not by loading another Core, such as 2048!  It will take 
approximately 10-15 seconds to successfully exit any given game.  Be patient!  Auto
frame skip should also be disabled, and frame skip set to 0.  Frame skip at 1 will 
work well for many stubborn games.  But, if you get black screen, switch back to 0!

**These darn games that simply will not work!**

I've heard the stories..."I tried this on every Core, multiple roms, etc, etc.  Nothing works!  Well, there is an entire subset of games that simply do not necessarily work in their base form, due to various factors...such as encryption, and so on!  Some of these include: Choplifter, E-Swat, Michael Jackson's Moonwalker, and so on.  In Xtras, Arcade, is a  non-working game ReadMe ( _km_mame2000_non-working_gamelist) to help one account for some of these.  It is best recommended you run alternate clones, bootleg versions, etc, in these specific, frustratingly annoying instances!  These specifically refer to MAME 2000, of course.  But, several of them have proven to be troublesome in later MAME Cores, as well.  So, take this with a grain of salt, to help you on the right path!  

When we worked on the Michael Jackson's Moonwalker Custom OST, this was most paramount to go with the bootleg version as the primary trigger file, for this very reason:)  Personal thanks to markwkidd for helping with the non-working games audit.

**Irem Rules, again, with Real Drum Mode Activate!**

Many of you have become quite accustomed to my spontaneous and random drumming, within the context of my videos.  And, Irem has always been one of my favorite companies to showcase.  As per my Showcase Video below, "Ninjas, Drums, and Samurai", you can see the amazing replacement of the offsets in a select number of Irem games, in lieu of Real Drum Mode Activate!  Yes, real Drums!  Enjoy!  Be sure to crank the bass up on your sound system!

You will need RetroArch Xtreme installed, and to use FBA 2016 or FBA 2018.  

Games that work with this amazing Golden Drum Awesomeness are Horizon, Kid Niki, Spelunker 1 and 2!  Have fun!

**Gambatte SGB (Super Game Boy) Borders HMOD 8 MB smaller!**

Like the MAME 2003 Plus Experimental Artwork HMOD, I also got the Gambatta SGB one down 8 MB.  This will help NAND Users better benefit with their limited space!

**RetroArch Xtreme Shaders Add-On 10 MB smaller!**

Remember, many of these shaders are quite cpu/gpu intensive, and generally more functional on PC!  Consider them fun for test purposes, mainly!  If you select a shader, and RetroArch becomes very slow to navigate, that generally means it won't fare well on the Mini.  You can use shortcut/home button combination to exit RetroArch, if need be...if it is far too slow to do anything.  When you reenter, it should be back to default shader. You can, additionally, select stock .glslp from RetroArch Settings, Shaders, in RetroArch Xtreme to get back to stock.  Worst case scenario, simply reinstalling RetroArch Xtreme will immediately get you back onto the most optimal shader set-up.  They are most certainly fun to play around with, as there are a multitude of nifty and fun effects to experience!  Be sure to check them out.  I would love to get any feedback on shaders any of you especially like!

**Sega Dreamcast pesky Date/Time fixed!**

Now, when running with /bin/reicast (Xtreme Mode), you won't have to set Date/Time anymore!  The only other way around this, up til this point, was to have an internet connection and set the Date/Time for it to stick.  Now, it is automatically set, and you won't have to worry about it, unless you need to run any stubborn games or such...using /bin/reicast-standard (Standard Mode).  Again, Standard Mode is very helpful for some Naomi/Atomiswave/Stubborn games, that otherwise suffer to do some of the accuracy changes to the overall Core Set-Up!  Personal thanks to flyinghead for the Date/Time fix!

**Sega Dreamcast VMU Fixed!**

Due to some changes in accuracy and such, the Dreamcast VMU has been a little slower to navigate.  Redownload it from KMFD Mod Hub in Hakchi2 CE, under Games Tab.  Then, re-export it, and it will run fast again:)  The VMU is an absolute necessity to help micromanage game saves!

**Sega Dreamcast compression!**

**NOTE: Important**  Due to how the memory and overall cpu/gpu intensive nature of the Dreamcast Core (Reicast works), I would only recommend using "this" compression for Dreamcast Games if you want to have the fun gimmick of running Dreamcast Games, 1 or a few at a time, strictly from NAND Internal Flash Memory!  You may encounter minor performance hits and be more prone to games crashing, as well.  I will do a follow-up, after this release, Video Tutorial going over the several nuances to adjust and acclimate to, regarding this and other Dreamcast, Atomiswave, Naomi Emulations on your Mini Classics!  I will also go over the "crash and performance" hitting scenarios!  Also, keep in mind, the other Cores that utilize .chd compression, as detailed below...are not affected by these potential issues on the Minis.  Reicast, as a whole, is most optimal on the PC platform.  As a result of the transition to a less optimal one, some issues are to be expected!  These may or not be easily fixed in future Updates!  But, many games I compressed ran absolutely fine!  Again, I will cover this all, in detail...in a near future Video!

This is a truly big thing that takes care of two birds with one stone, so to speak:)  One, when adding "many" .gdi files, particularly smaller ones...which are essentially .cue files pointing to the game data files...They would be overwritten by new additions, frequently.  You might add one game, have it all ready to go.  Then, you would be surprised by adding another .gdi file, and it deleting the other one previous to that!  This is because hakchi read the files as being identical.  There are a few solutions I shared for this.  But, I added yet another one, which will be much better as a whole!  Of course, it may still need a little work to be fully fleshed out for "us".

Like with Sega CD and Turbografx CD and 3DO and PC-FX, you can "now" convert Dreamcast Games into CHD files.  This will ONLY work with /bin/reicast (Xtreme Mode).  /bin/reicast-standard will not support CHD!  To utilize CHD format for Xtreme Mode, simply go into Xtras/Tools/CHDMAN, use 32/64 bit, whichever suits your Operating System.  Then, run the _km_bin_cue_&_gdi_&_iso_to_chd to convert your .gdi and game data files to one single CHD!  Remember, .CDI are a different format, and are fine as they stand.  This is meant, particularly, for .gdi files relating to Dreamcast.  

I have Updated CHDMAN, so you will now have an appropriate V5 CHD format, after conversion!  You will get better conversions for the previous 4 systems mentioned, as well (Sega CD, Turbografx CD, 3DO, and PC-FX).

For best results, copy entire game contents you want to convert to the CHDMAN Folder, or the contents of CHDMAN Folder to the folder with the game you want to convert!  I would not at all recommend attempting to convert games already on USB, as it will take far longer than normal, than just doing conversion directly from Hard Drive!  Enjoy this amazing, near 7zip quality compression!  Yes, this means you can even run some Dreamcast Games and the Core, strictly from NAND, now...if you are Non-USB-HOST!  But, USB-HOST will always be the recommended course of action to do so, regardless!  Options are nice:)

**8Bitdo SN30 GP support added!**

We don't want to be stuck with the default NES/SNES Controllers for the NESC/SNESC, respectively!  I try to add every possible controller that might function on the Mini Classics.  This time around, those of you who have the 8bitdo SN30 GP peripherals, are in luck!  Also added are 8BitDo_Pro2_N30_BT, 8BitDo N30 Pro2, the Sony-PlayStation4-DualShock4v2, and several others.  Remember, depending on whether you run with a wireless receiver or via USB, and combination of firmware...results may vary.  But, over 300+ controllers are currently supported with RetroArch Xtreme! 

**Final Burn Alpha better emulated light gun support!**

Not only will most Light Gun oriented games play better with FBA 2018, this Release...But, 2 games that previously had bad control issues are now properly fixed up and should play quite a deal better...None other than the fantastic On Rails Shooters, Steel Gunner 1 and 2 (Really, the first time these 2 great games were playable on the Mini Classics!)  Personal thanks to barbudreadmon and dinkc64 for helping make Final Burn Alpha as truly amazing as it is as a whole!  Get Gunning with some nifty light gun games!

**PrBoom has better and more optimal and precise mouse support!**

When utilizing a mouse with any of the Doom Games supported with PrBoom, including Doom, Doom II, Final Doom and some other Doom IWAD mods.  It is much closer and proportional to the original PC experience, now!  Personal thanks to Ferk

**Amstrad CPC Core overhauled!**

The Core that runs Amstrad CPC is km Caprice32.  Bios are not required:)  Personal thanks to DSkywalker, who has done a pretty extensive overhaul to the Core, and it has many fixes and additions to make it a better overall experience...including loading the Core without content, making _DUMMY folder more viable.  A similar issue existed with the earlier releases of PPSSPP Core!  Larger games now work, including Shadow of the Beast.  Autorun coding has been fixed up and better optimized.  Games should autorun, by default, once loaded.  The amazing keyboard/mapping support that fr500 helped out with in Cores such as BlueMSX, effectively works with this Core, now, too!  Again, thanks DSkywalker, for helping make one of my favorite Cores even better!  

**Pesky -30 MB Bug!?**

This has been a burden of a Bug for some.  Although, luckily, it is not overly common.  It is seemingly random and doesn't affect many.  Still, when it hits your set-up, it definitely takes the fun out of gaming.  What essentially happens is, while attempting to install RetroArch, whichever version...it may not fully install.  Instead, you will end up with an unusable system, and Hakchi will read -30 MB available!  You typically need to do a kernel uninstall/reset to get out of this predicament)  Good news is, I was able to determine the cause of this bug, and minimize it so that you have a good 99.5 percent of not running into it when installing any of the RetroArch Xtremes in my set.  Turns out, it was a leftover remnant bug from the earlier NES Classic Days.  All good now!  And, you have far less change of ever having it trigger!

**And, of course!...a tremendous Shout-Out to a great friend, supporter, and fellow YouTuber!**

Sometimes, if someone on YouTube uses Patreon...they might have a preset donation level, wherein someone can get their channel Shouted-Out to.  I will never embrace this sort of thing.  If I like someone's channel, I will Shout-Out to it on my own free will.  Dank Games has been a very loyal supporter, great friend, and a fellow YouTuber that wholeheartedly shares my passion for RetroGaming.  Be sure to check his channel out!  He plays a variety of games from a whole myriad of systems.  And, like me, he does his best to respond to each and every comment!  Speaking of which, once this Update is posted, next up is catching up on my many messages and emails!  For now, give his channel a shot, and enjoy the awesomeness!

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6fMrosRBLvaV3imogXjUg/featured

I won't shout out to anyone, YouTube wise, unless they are comfortable with me doing so.  

**Other Current & Future Additions!**

Nearly everything in the Core Set has gotten touched up in some way, shape or form! Several bugs that have been reported to me have been fixed, including a collision detection one with Intellivision.  Personal thanks to gingerbeardman for the help with collision, and mavis99 for reporting it to me.  

There are now 4 N64 Cores in the Set.  Personal thanks to m4xw and CompCom for helping make possible the 4th variant, Mupen Plus Next from the Nintendo Switch.  So, now, to quadruple use all 4 Cores, you will use the following Command Lines:

/bin/glupen  /bin/mupen  /bin/mupen-next  /bin/parallel

Glupen has the best performance and speed.  Then, Mupen/Mupen-Next, then Parallel.  It is generally a good idea to test a game on all of them, to see which nets the best individual results.  IE: Mario 64 runs amazingly well on Parallel!  If I decidedly want to play a particular game, I just test it on Glupen, first.  Then, I go down the line.  Note: Suspend States are unreliable.  But, In-Game Saves work fine for all 4 of these when used in combination with RetroArch Xtreme.

Quite a bit of testing has been done over the last month to best accommodate these many changes!  Enjoy this Great Release, and Happy Gaming!

As far as Upcoming Additions and such, I have been asked about many things.  Some of them are still WIP and will be accounted for via video or the Next Updates.  Many have asked me about Nintendo Power, Mad Magazine...two magazines, of which I scanned nearly the entire collections 14+ years back.  I have many things on my agenda.  Nintendo Power is most certainly still one of them.  When I do get a few hours to dig back into it, I will put together something for you Retro Enthusiasts to enjoy, video and otherwise!  

I will also cover my personal method of Disk Swapping, that does not, at all, utilize .m3u.  I much prefer my method.  I just need to get a video tutorial up to help many of you who are stuck with .m3us onto a nifty, alternate method!

I am also working more with DOSBox, of course!  Personal thanks to game cleaner and Beylie for their help in testing various things I have been implementing. 

There is also another special thing coming next Release, related to Themes:)

And, yes, I am also working with PS Classic.  That stuff should show up within the Next Release or few:)

If I have not gotten to your message, feel free to rebump it.  I typically get anywhere from 100-300 messages a day.  Occasionally, some slip through the cracks.  I do my best to try to help each and every one of you that requests personal assistance.

**The Videos:)!**

Don't worry, the Cats and Drumming will make more appearances in future Videos!  Feel free to request any songs you'd like to see me drum to!

There are many, many additions and such that I have not even gotten into within the Release Notes, that I will do videos on after this Release!  So, you will have a whole smorgasbord of other things to experience that you may not necessarily be aware of until I showcase them:)  Think of this as an open world adventure with many new things to discover each and every new Update!

**PS Classic Bandersnatch Principle?!  Adding games with Hakchi!**

Many of you may remember from my last PS Classic Video, that I emphasized the importance of being careful with any modifications that are floating about.  This was due to the fact that it was potentially possible to soft brick your systems.  Some of the variants were set up in such a way that system files were being overwritten, rather than overmounted.  Things are getting better day by day!  And, modding will become increasingly safer, as well!  This brings me to an unreleased modification, of which you will see me utilizing in the video down below the Release Notes!  This aforementioned greatness will be released in the near future!  

If you aren't familiar with Bandersnatch, it is a new Netflix Black Mirror Special, that has an incredibly cool gimmick...a Choose Your Own Adventure style scenario!  You get screen prompts at various places within the movie, with which you can alter the course of the main character's actions.  It is inventive, very fun, and nicely laid out.  I enjoyed this same gimmick in a very obscure Horror Movie from roughly a decade ago, called Return to House on Haunted Hill.  I would absolutely love to see more movies/tv/etc follow suit and have these determine the outcome endeavors.  Very cool stuff, without a doubt!  That being said...

Hakchi implementation for PS Classic is going to be very much "Bandersnatch Principle" like, wherein feedback from you Guys and Gals will determine how deeply rooted and involved the incorporation becomes!  I have been pushing for Hakchi to be used, as I feel it is a stable and solid brand that many of us have grown to love over the last 2 years.  My concept video will have me using Hakchi to add games for use on the PS Classic!  Your feedback on my YouTube Comments and/or on the Reddit Posts, as well as any personal communication with me, otherwise...will greatly be a deciding factor on the future of PS Classic in conjunction with Hakchi!

 **PS Classic Upcoming Modification Reveal!**

The modification you see me using in the video link below is, from this point forward, to be known as PSpwned.  This is a gentle play on the somewhat lax, less than stellar, lackluster security provisions that ended up being a double edged sword of epic disproportions, due to Sony's need to rush said system out before Xmas!  By taking the quick payoff approach, rather than going for longevity, and ensuring a better lineup of default games (SOTN anyone!), reviews quickly surfaced that ripped the entire Release apart...not to mention the 40 percent price drops within days!  It was inevitable that it was going to be hacked and cracked.  But, the Xmas Rush certainly made it a bit easier, considering Sony left the security keys on the system!  Oops!  Direct Root access was gained via a UART connection, and the system files dumped in under 2 days, thanks to many great people in the scene!

I don't think many of us could have done any better, considering the circumstances.  Deadlines to rush a product out before Xmas has been a nail in the coffin, time and time again (E.T. Atari 2600)!  It is still a very impressive little device capable of so much potential awesomeness, despite its bad vanilla aftertaste!  As a modded system, it is as cool as Yee-Hah SkyRim (Red Dead Redemption!)

I have always been a tremendous fan of Sony Video Game Systems, and have amassed a collection of PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, PSP, VIta, and so on.  I still respect and adore the company, despite their shortcomings with the badly timed PS Classic Release!  I do find the specs to be quite admirable, and am already getting things to run somewhat better here than on the Mini NES/SNES!  Greatness will continue to come, that is for sure!

The first hack that was pseudo leaked to the internet, before it was properly finished up and tested, was LOLHACK.  It was not intended to so quickly reach the masses.  It was meant to be tested for bugs, fixed, then Released!  Since some modified the base coding, this is where the bad overwriting inadvertently and unintentionally happened!  This is also why I even did my first PS Classic Video, to warn against the inherent dangers of modding your PS Classic, too early!  I am very happy to report, I am absolutely thrilled and very comfortable with how PSpwned is going!  It will truly be a fantastic modification that properly overmounts system files, rather than overwriting them!  Many more tweaks and changes will be added in the future!  

Remember, the feedback of you Guys and Gals is a huge factor in how deeply rooted Playstation Classic/PSpwned harmoniousness becomes incorporated as a whole!  Extra special thanks to madmonkey and DanTheMan827!  Think of this scenario as a pseudo petition, reaching out for the Hakchi or Hakchi like cause!  Thank you all for the tremendous amount of Support on this idea, thus far...comment wise, from my below Video!

**PS Classic Tools for ISO/BIN/CUE/APE/ECM, etc. Ripping & Conversions!**

I have already put together a very nice and comprehensive set of Tools that one can use for PS1 Games on their Mini NES/SNES/PS1!  These are in Xtras/Tools/PS1.  You can do practically anything from basic ripping with PocketISO, to Intermediate Merging of Bins with CDMage, to advanced tactics, such as contending with .ape, .ecm, (typically Japanese Games) etc. files, to even dealing with super advanced ripping of troublesome games, such as Crash Bandicoot!, all with the Tools I have provided within the context of the Core Set Release.  I have done several videos utilizing all of these tools, over the last couple of years.  But, I have been personally using them for decades previous.  Enjoy them, and feel free to let me know if you need any direction in using any of them!  They have already proven incredibly useful and highly practical with the conventions of the PS Classic! 

**PS Classic Controllers on Mini NES/SNES!**

If you use RetroArch Xtreme, any version, Playstation Classic Default Controllers will work with OTG and USB-HOST on your Mini NES/SNES!  Personal thanks to AluCarD for testing, and andshrew and hizzlekizzle for helping out with this clever and nifty addition!  This is certainly a nice convenience for those of you who only have NES/SNES Default Controllers with each respective system!

**NEO GEO CD!  Full Sound & Speed Ahead!**

Another notch on the most wanted belt off the list.  We now have Full Sound and Full Speed Neo Geo CD on the Mini Classics!  This has easily been one of the most requested things over the last two years, along with Dreamcast and Nintendo DS and PSP!  We now have a Trifecta Plus One of pure awesomeness, or a Superfecta!  

Definitive Versions of many of your most favorite Neo Geo Classic Games, complete with Full CD Rearranged Soundtracks!

You will need to install Neo Geo CD 2018 Core and may also use Master BIOS Module to add the pertinent BIOS.  At the root of system, create a neocd folder.  Then, inside, extract Neo Geo CD Bios.  The two files you should have are neocd_z.rom and ng-lo.rom  Command Line is /bin/neocd2018  The Master BIOS Module, Xtras/Bios and Commands have also been updated. 

Showcase and Tutorial Video is below Release Notes.  I have also included tools to help with the conversion process of the Neo Geo CD Games.  Audacity for converting .wavs to .flac (high quality and lossless, especially if ripped directly from the real Neo Geo CDs!; or .ogg (MP3 size and quality).  .Wavs do not work, for the time being.  You can also use find and replace, also in tools, to fix up the .cue files!  

Brought to you by the cumulative and collaborative efforts of Fabrice, madmonkey, myself, and bslenul:)

**Dreamcast Multi-Disk Support!**

This has been one of the most requested feature additions for Reicast!  You can now play Multi-Disk Games with this Update.  It will only work with Xtreme Mode, /bin/reicast and best results with RetroArch 1.7.5 Xtreme!  Enjoy Shenmue 1 and 2, Grandia, and many more, which should be fully playable to the 2nd Disks, now!  RetroArch Settings, Disk Control, once prompted for disk changes!  Personal thanks to Autechre, flying head, and everyone else involved with this phenomenally awesome Dreamcast Core!

**SNES9x Cores have better sound, pitch wise!  Final Fantasy fans rejoice!**

One thing some of you might have become adjusted to over the last couple of years, was the fact that SNES9x Cores typically had better sound with the greater accuracy of the higher year Cores.  But, performance and speed generally suffered as a result, on some games, due to the same great performance and accuracy.  I have personally found a happy and satisfying median with SNES9x 2005, of which I run most of my more stubborn SNES games with.  If you ever have slowdown issues with 2010 or 2016, by all means try 2005 or 2002!  

What is great, with this Update, is that games such as Final Fantasy VI, which have absolutely butchered and bad sound pitch...are now sounding a hell of a lot better with a more proper pitch fix, courtesy of jdgleaver!  He has also done some tremendous stuff with Gambatte, amongst other things!  SNES9x2002, 2005, and 2005 Plus all have this better sound, and are very effective for games that you cannot normally run at a good speed on 2010 and 2016 and 2016 Bright!  Of course, 2016 and 2016 Bright are the main ones you'd need to use for MSU-1, and games that will not run properly on the older Cores!  So, it is definitely great to have a combination of SNES9x Cores installed.  I have them set up so you can multi-wield them with /bin/snes02, /bin/snes05, /bin/snes05-plus, /bin/snes10, bin/snes16, and snes9x-bright.  Remember, if you ever are uncertain of any Command Lines you can use for any of the Cores in my set, you can refer to the ReadMe windows while viewing in Hakchi, as well as go into Xtras/Commands!  

Additionally, SNES9x 2016 is now bumped from 1.56 to 1.57, for even better compatibility, accuracy, amongst other perks!

**MAME 2003 Plus Experimental Fuller Speed Ahead!**

Grant2258 has been going out of his way to help ensure the MiniNES/SNES experience is as great as possible for MAME 2003 Plus Experimental.  We have been changing several things, to account for the lesser hardware, and testing them out, accordingly.  There are some speed hacks in place, with today's Release, that benefit many stubborn games!  Some, like Narc, while they now run better, will likely remain best on MAME 2000!  But, like SNES9x Cores, outlined above, it is nice to have a combination of Arcade Cores!  With 1.7.4 and 1.7.5 Xtreme, Cores install at 75 percent smaller.  So, keep that in mind.  It is easier than ever to maintain a solid variety of Cores to contend with accuracy, performance, speed, and otherwise, with the lesser space being used, overall!

**MAME 2003 Plus Experimental Beautiful Backdrop and Border Art!**

This is, by far, one of the greatest things I have had the pleasure of adding to my set.  Many Arcade Games, over the years, such as Discs of Tron, have never truly been authentic to the Arcade Experience.  You can now install MAME 2003 Plus Experimental in conjunction with RetroArch Xtreme and the RetroArch Artwork MAME 2003 Plus HMODs, to net some incredibly beautiful, closer to the true Arcade Experience many of us have envisioned over the years!  You can see these being used in the SNES Classic - MAME 2003 Plus Showcase - Full Speed Ahead! - Part 4 Video, below!  Huge personal thanks to nearly a years worth of work, off and on...involving Grant2258, markwkidd, dankcushions, nayslayer, arcadez, and the rest of the MAME 2003 Plus Team!!  And, of course, huge thanks to any and all who have worked on the backdrops and borders over the years!  This is another beautiful thing that will become updated over time.  You can view the list of "supported games" in Xtras/Arcade/MAME 2003 Plus Artwork ReadMe, as well as in ReadMe, while Artwork HMOD is viewed within Hakchi.  Nearly 160 games currently supported.  I can and may add support for others, depending on feedback.  So, feel free to request.

**MAME 2003 Plus Experimental History and Cheats!**

Personal thanks to Grant2258, markwkidd, arcadez, and the rest of the Team for fixing things, so that History and Cheats properly scroll and work again!  I have updated the History and Cheats HMODS, accordingly!  In order to use these, once installed...go into RetroArch Settings, Core Options, Enable MAME Menu, choose Cheats and/or History.  Once done, Disable MAME Menu in Core Options.  It will remain on screen until you disable it.  This is effectively awesome for those who only have NES/SNES Controllers, as you do not have to worry about L2 or R2, like you typically have to with MAME 2003 Standard/Xtreme.  Of course, if you do run those MAME 2003 Variants, and don't have a proper R2 button, you can temporarily remap R2 to R1, then change back when done!

**Gambatte SGB Borders!**

mGBA has SGB Border Support.  Gambatte is generally the better Game Boy/Game Boy Color Core for us on the Mini Classics.  So, I put together a setup, so that those who love Gambatte can run Super Game Boy Borders.  The HMOD is _km_retroarch_sgb_borders_gambatte  Once this is installed, you can go into RetroArch Settings, Onscreen Display, Enable Display, then choose SGB 16x9 and select from over 800 SGB Borders!  Choose whichever .cfg file you'd like to use.  To revert, you can go into RetroArch Video Settings, aspect ratio, and choose whichever one you want to use, be it 4:3 or 16:9 or Core Provided, etc.  Then, from Onscreen Display, select default .cfg.  If you already use other Borders with Gambatte for GB/GBC games, I would suggest running those with mGBA and/or Gearboy, as the aspect for these SGB Borders are more optimized for a 16:9 styled appearance.  I have personally been having a fun swapping out the 800 Plus Borders on even Non-SGB games.  The Blaster Master Border is particularly nice!  Again, you can run most of these via mGBA.  But, if you want more accurate GB/GBC emulation, whilst still having ability to run SGB Borders, this is a great alternative! 

**Druid: Kyoufu no Tobira for Famicom Disk System fixed!**

If you are a fan of Gauntlet styled, rogue-like games, you will be right at home with this gem of a game!  It previously had awful menu glitches!  You can run this with RetroArch Xtreme and /bin/fceumm  Enjoy!  Personal thanks to retro-wertz for the IRQ timing fix required to pull this off!  Feel free to try out other games you may have previously had issues with.  You might find them working and/or better now, with this great fix in place.

**More Games on KMFD Mod Hub!**

If you had trouble running any of these last time, Update to the latest Core/Version Requisites with this Release.  I have added more games to enjoy, such as a great canceled Dreamcast one called Drill; Lawn Mower for NES; Zombienator for Uzebox!  I also added the DC (VMU (Dreamcast Visual Memory Unit).  You will need to install RetroArch Xtreme to use it.  Have fun!  Be sure to check out the other games, such as Cave Story MD/NXE, 2048, and so on!  I will add more in the future! 

**Other Updates!**

Updated MESS 2016 Dependencies, RetroArch Xtreme Shaders, and nearly 50 other Cores with various Bug Fixes, Optimizations, and additions.  If you had any trouble running any Cores, such as Gambatte/Mr. Boom/Uzem, last Release...they are fixed now!  Sorry for any inconvenience!  Thank you Jul Car and TheWez1981, for the heads up on Gambatte!  Occasionally, segfault and other conflicts or issues come into play, and break a Core.  P-UAE, P-UAE Xtreme, UAE4ARM, UAE4ARM Xtreme, all had this problem until madmonkey helped sort it out!  Other Cores that have occasionally had this issue, have been Gambatte, ViceX64, and DOSBox.  I appreciate any feedback, as always, to help keep this a nice, smooth running Core Set!  Thank you all!

Personal thanks to game cleaner and Beylie for helping test DOSBox changes that might come into play within the next Release or few!  For now, if you plan on running DOSBox and/or EasyRPG via main UI, I would suggest changing /var/games to /var/saves, copy the entire CLV folder to hakchi/saves on USB.  But, if you reexport, recopy the CLV from hakchi/saves back over top, and allow it to overwrite...the main Exported CLV.  This will change in future Updates, and potentially be incorporated directly into Hakchi2 CE! 

**WIP for Next Update!**

Videos and such related to, "Now You're Playing With Power" and more "PS Classic" goodness and "Holy Diver the NES game, as well as, my real life, personal Dio story...where a fight broke out!, are tentatively WIP by Next Update.  Also, I will be updating PSP in a couple special ways.  Every Release I throw a few things onto the immediate agenda.  And, I do my best to get them added!  I will likely lay some focus on Cheats as one of the other primary upcoming additions!  Anything else any of you would like to see, let me know!  I will see what I can do as far as getting things accounted for.  But, I will continue to focus equally on Mini NES/SNES/PS1, with the new personal motto, "No System Left Behind!"
