**You can now run TRUE BS-X Games via the SNES9x 2016 Core!**

-Once you follow the below steps, and load a BS-X Game via
_DUMMY Folder or Main UI, you will enter "The Town With No
Name".  In this Town, simply enter the house you spawn in 
front of, then select the Load Data Option, then select Game!
Sfroms will NOT work!!!  Read Steps Below!

1.  You will need BS-X Bios!

1.  Extract BSXBIOSEnglish2016v13.zip

2.  Use either beat_v01 or floating_ips and patch the BS-X Bios
with the extracted BS-X BIOS English Patch 2016 v1.3.bps

3.  Rename the patched BS-X Bios to BS-X.bin

4.  Copy it into Master BIOS Module/system folder

5.  Install like any other HMOD!  

6.  Enjoy the BS-X Games!

NOTE:

Hakchi2 CE converts SNES Games into .Sfrom Format.  This Format will NOT
work with BS-X Games!  So, you have to use a special workaround!  Simply take
any given BS-X Game, that is already in zipped format, and 7zip it.  Then, add
it via Hakchi2, and it will bypass the Sfrom Conversion!  Essentially, two 
layers of compression will be unreadable by Hakchi2, and bypass the Conversion!
Those who use NES Classic, can just add games, per normal!  Sfroms are only for
use with SNES Classic!  

So, again:)

1.  BS-X Rom Set, if extracted, zip it, THEN 7zip it, then add via Hakchi2!

2.  BS-X Rom Set, if in zip, 7zip it, then add via Hakchi2!

Command Line needs to be /bin/snes if ONLY SNES9x 2016 is installed.  And, it
needs to be /bin/snes16 or /bin/snes/9x if more than one SNES9x Core is installed.
The other Cores would need to be /bin/snes02  /bin/snes05  /bin/snes10

Also, Sfroms will NOT work from _DUMMY Folder!  So, the Sfrom Bypass Method is 
perfect for any and all instances where one would run into a conflict with
attempting to run SNES Games that are not supportive of Sfrom Format!

Sincerely, KMFDManic!!!
