With feedback from the Community, we will amass a great list of working/non-working games!

Testing Credits thus far: Butter_Spill, Rockmangames & Myself:)  CTRL+F in this document for fully playable to get Rockmangames'
results for games that "should" be fine on this Core! Looking forward to more feedback to boost this list and have as many
games known to be playable as possible for all of you Guys and Gals!  Thank You!

Note: Some Rockmangames' Test Results may vary, being that we are running these on the Mini NES/SNES!  They were originally tested
on PC!  But, the top-most Test Results are ones that were officially tested to actually load and/or be fully playable on the Minis!

Sincerely, KMFDManic!!!  

DeSmuNE 2015: (Testing Credits: Butter_Spill & Myself.  If a game doesn't initially work, we will still attempt to retest it under
different conditions, in hopes that it may potentially still work!   We will also take into account which games are "too slow", or 
"fully playable", other noteworthy things to mention, and so on! So, this list will be Updated in future releases!!!) 

Working: (Either fully playable and/or load!  Overall game speed varies, case by case!)
