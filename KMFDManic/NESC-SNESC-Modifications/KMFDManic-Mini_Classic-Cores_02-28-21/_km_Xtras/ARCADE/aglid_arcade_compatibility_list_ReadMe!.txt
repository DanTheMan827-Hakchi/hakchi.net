---- Cores ----

3 = /mame2003
10 = /mame2010
12 = /fba2012
16 = /fba2016

cps1 is in red because the game probably also work with one of the 4 cores above. 

Not used of now:

2k = /mame2000
14 = /mame2014

---- Notes ----

BS = A bit slow (and most likely music issues), but playable.

NS = No Sound

EFN = Extra file needed. This is the extra file you have to load in hakchi, not the main rom. 
Once the add-on loaded and recorded, copy the main rom into the game folder.

BGF = BIOS needed in game folder, meaning this one won't work with the master bios module.


---- BIOS ----

Needed in master Bios Module: qsound.zip


---- Info ----

Neo Geo games are not in this Arcade list (Arcore). 

The games were tested in this order: mame2003 -> mame2010 -> fba2012 -> fba2016.
It means games working fine with core "3" may also work with other cores, but I didn't feel the need to try.
At the very beginning, I was using fba2012. So, there are a few games listed as "12" that could eventually work with "3" or "10".
Games I remember using fba2012 first: Haunted Castle, R-Type, Prehistoric Ilse 1930.

I didn't go far in most of the games. But when I did... shit happened sometimes. 
As example, Secret Agent makes the sound crash in stage 3 with mame2003. 
So... if you experience an issue with one of the listed games, please let us know.
