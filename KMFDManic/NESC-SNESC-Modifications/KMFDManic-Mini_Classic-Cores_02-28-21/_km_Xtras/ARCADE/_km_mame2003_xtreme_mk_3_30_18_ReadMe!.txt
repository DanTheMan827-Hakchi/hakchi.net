Thanks to the hard work and dedication and patience of gpstar!,
we now have support in MAME 2003 Xtreme for the ability to run a very special Custom
Soundtrack with Mortal Kombat, specifically, most optimal for use with rom set mkla1.zip
gpstar has done an exceptional job!

Sincerely, KMFDManic!!!  (May we only get more of these incredible Custom OST Mods in the future, for MAME 2003!:)

gpstar Notes:)

In my spare time the last few days i'd been messing around with the Midway/Williams Y and T unit drivers in mame2003.  I had been 
putting together a music update to Mortal Kombat. I always thought the original had good tunes but shitty quality music hardware.
So I searched around the internet and built up a sample pack together while looking for various remixes of the original songs,
which I thought best fit the game and started hacking away for the byte offsets. The Y-Unit versions of Mortal Kombat run better 
in Mame2003 compared to the T-Unit version. I prefer mkla1.zip romset.

Midway Y-Unit versions of Mortal Kombat, which are the following romsets:

mkla1.zip (This one is best suited for this Custom OST:)
mkla2.zip
mkla3.zip
mkla4.zip
mkprot9.zip

The Midway T-Unit versions:

mk.zip (not as good for this Custom OST)

It works the exact same way as the Final Fight OST, if a file doesn't exist, it fallsback to the original sound from the game etc.
 
List of the sample names if people want to compile there own are as follows (and just like the Final Fight OST, -01 is the left channel,
-02 is the right channel):
