This list will be updated with PAST and CURRENT and
FUTURE Updates, relative to what has been promoted 
from NOT-WORKING Status, to WORKING in some way,
shape or form!  I have others to add to THIS list!
So, keep checking back in future Updates to see what 
I add to it:)  Also, you can post your own findings
and test results HERE, so they can be added to the
great list that realcreamstick has been compiling

https://www.reddit.com/r/miniSNESmods/comments/7gqaim/snes_mini_arcade_compatibilty_list/ 

And, thanks to deathr0w, here is a secondary Arcade Compatibility List!

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dbpVRB7xmksBejGtsDy3XVc6gn1cvWDN9rLMzHa68rM/edit?usp=sharing

I will keep in contact with him and we will all work together to boost the overall 
knowledge of what is and is not compatible on our NESC/SNESC Systems!

For now, I have these ones to add:)  Like I said, expect more to pop into this
list in future Updates!!!  Only install ONE MAME 2003 Core at a time!

KMFDManic:)

The three current MAME 2003 Variant Cores are as follow: (NOTE: Highly recommended to use RetroArch Xtreme, in conjunction with any of the
following for best results...and to most fully take advantage of performance and speed!)

MAME 2003 Plus Experimental /bin/mame2003-plus Second most optimal Core for Xtreme Set, with many amazing benefits, such as analog support, 
authentic Arcade Borders (with the _km_retroarch_artwork_mame2003_plus HMOD), and very special additional compatibility for many games not
normally working within the context of MAME 2003 Standard.  MAME 2003 Xtreme also supports "most" of these. To get more specific details, 
be sure to View the _km_mame2003_plus_&_xtreme_compatibility.txt!

MAME 2003 Standard /bin/mame2003-standard This is the Most stable MAME 2003 Core for Purists who would rather not have the Experimental
Changes that typically go into MAME 2003 Plus and Xtreme!        

MAME 2003 Xtreme /bin/mame2003 This is the most optimal and default MAME 2003 Core in the Xtreme Set, as far as performance, speed, 
and overall usability.  There are countless fixes and such for Irem, Taito, Sega System 32, Nintendo Vs. Games, etc...as well as 
Custom OST Support for Final Fight, Mortal Kombat, NBA Jam, Michael Jackson's Moonwalker, Double Dragon, and OutRun!  Like MAME
2003 Plus Experimental, many more games work than typically supported!  View the _km_mame2003_plus_&_xtreme_compatibility.txt! 

Some nifty changes for this specific Update include sample fixes to account for certain conditions leading to some games not properly
starting/stopping music samples when triggered to!  TMNT Arcade and X-Men: Children of the Atom are two primary examples. 

Countless games had issues where refresh rate was not properly calculated and adjusted, leading to multiple improperly or non-working 
games.  These include RoboCop, Midway/Bally (Tapper, Rampage, Journey, etc.)  I had fixes in place to run Midway/Bally Games with 
combination of RetroArch Xtreme and MAME 2003 Xtreme.  But, this is no ordinary fix.  This time, you can run Midway/Bally, RoboCop,
hundreds others with ANY RetroArch in conjunction with MAME 2003 Xtreme!  But, keep in mind, you will always have the "best" and 
most optimal performance, speed, stability results, if you use RetroArch Xtreme along with MAME 2003 Xtreme!  They are very fine-
tuned to work harmoniously with one another.  Stubborn games can get anywhere from a 15-20 percent Performance/Speed boost!  

Next up, Vector Games have been fixed up to look very authentic, vibrant, bold, beautiful, and much closer approximated to their
Arcade Originals!  Load up Tempest, and just see how amazing and wonderful it is now!  For an added element of awesomeness, be 
sure to go into RetroArch Video Settings, enable bilinear filtering.  Remember to turn it back off when done!  It helps smooth
and better accentuate the vector lines.  But, it won't do any justice to more detailed games, such as Marvel Vs. Capcom!  

SSV is a fantastic piece of hardware that is a culmination of the combined efforts of Sammy, 

Performance Compatibility Update for MAME 2003 Xtreme!  A multitude of games have better speed and performance, from Data East
ones, such as Night Slashers!, to Sega System 32, Irem, and many, many more!  Taito F3 Games, in particular, get a nice boost this
time around!  Taito F3 Games with Performance and Speed Boosts include:

NOTE: Might have control or start issues with some of these, for now.  

Arabian Magic (arabianm, arabiamj, and arabiamu)
Arkanoid Returns (arkretrn)
Bubble Memories (bubblem and bubblemj)
Bubble Symphony / Bubble Bobble 2 (bublbob2, bubsympe, bubsymph, and bubsympu)
Cleopatra Fortune (cleopatr)
Darius Gaiden - Silver Hawk (dariusg, dariusgj, dariusgu, and dariusgx) 
Dungeon Magic AKA Light Bringer (dungenmu, dungeonm, and lightbr) 
Elevator Action Returns (elvact2u, elvactr, and elvactrj)
Gekirindan (gekirido)
Grid Seeker (gseeker, gseekerj, and gseekeru) 
International Cup '94 (intcup94)
Kaiser Knuckle / Global Champion / Dan-Ku-Ga (kaiserkj and kaiserkn)
LandMaker (landmakr and landmkrp) 
Pop 'N Pop (popnpop, popnpopj, and popnpopu)
Puzzle Bobble 2 / Bust-A-Move Again (pbobble2)
Puzzle Bobble 3 (pbobble3)
Puzzle Bobble 4 (pbobble4)
Puchi Carat (puchicar)
RayForce (rayforce and rayforcj)
Riding Fight (ridingf)
Ring Rage (ringrage, ringragj, and ringragu) 
Super Cup Finals (scfinals)
Space Invaders '95 - The Attack of Lunar Loonies (spcinv95)
Top Ranking Stars (trstar, trstarj, trstaro, and trstaroj)

SSV Hardware Games also get some noticeable sound improvement fixes!  Note: Not all of these will work.  But, the coding to fix
sound is in place. And, nearly every one I have tested has worked fine with MAME 2003 Xtreme!

MAME 2003 Developer Test Kit:)

You now (for right now, at least!) have 3 MAME 2003 Variants!  You will get to test
out many things, if you so choose to!  But, ideally, in the long-run, once bugs are
all sorted out, there will be collaboration and communication to merge as much of 
the code from all 3 together into one harmoniously awesome singular MAME 2003, 
that effectively works the same way on PC, Mini, RetroPie, and many other formats!
Some of my changes are being merged into the PC MAME 2003s, and vice versa, in the
meantime:)  Feedback is greatly appreciated, as it will help with bettering MAME
2003 in the immediate and distant future:)  If you are not concerned with hi-score
ability, or seeing the latest Coding changes, just stick with MAME 2003 Xtreme
(Command Line /bin/mame2003 )

-MAME 2003 Xtreme (Command Line is /bin/mame2003 ) is my own personal Variant, which
includes several optimizations, including Irem Games with encryption fixes, Data East
Games with encryption fixes, Sega System 32 Games, Midway Bally-Atari Vector Games, 
Custom OSTs (courtesy of the great work of gpstar!) for Final Fight, Mortal Kombat,
NBA Jam, and Out Run.  It can now, additionally, run the great Konami Basketball 
Arcade Classic Run and Gun! (Personal thanks to markwkidd for helping with the 
very clever and amazing bootstramp nvram initialization fix!)  

-MAME 2003 Hi-Score (Command Line is /bin/mame2003-hi-score ) has ability to use
and save Hi-Scores for MANY, but not ALL Games! Games must be run from the main UI,
in order for Hi-Scores to be able to properly save.  Simply get a hi-score in any
given game. Then, exit said game.  When you reload the same game, if hi-score is
still present, it works for that game!  Being that the hi-score addition is a very
new feature for the Mini, and may still be buggy...do not expect 110 percent
reliability!  You will also need to install the _km_retroarch_hi_score_mame2003 HMOD!
Further work will be done with hi-score ability in the future, so it should get
better and more reliable!  But, it is a very fun addition to try out, at the 
moment!

-MAME 2003 Plus Experimental (Command Line is /bin/mame2003-plus ) is a culmination
of the most current coding changes! This is a very Experimental Core, and ONLY 
recommended (for now, at least!) for those who truly want to see how things 
essentially work in the latest Code!
