One patch allows 3 Player Mode Activate, just like in Secret of Mana. (Also works on Trials of Mana!)

The other translates into English, if you so decide to not run the newer English Trials of Mana!

Thanks to those who have worked on the patches!  Lunar IPS can be used to apply them to the games!
