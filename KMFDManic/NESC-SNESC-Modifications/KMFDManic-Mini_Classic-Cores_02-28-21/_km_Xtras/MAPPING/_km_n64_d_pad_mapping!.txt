  As of the latest Update, you can use premade mappers that myself, BlackSunshine, and MadFranko008 have 
put together, to allow mapping of SNES Equivalent controllers, for non-analog, solely D-Pad usage!  But,
you can essentially do it however you so choose to, as well, per the following, very easy to follow, 
instructions!  Mappers will be updated in future Releases, for many systems!

  For SNES/NES/MD, you can grab the N64 Mappers HMOD from Hakchi, Modules, KMFD Mod Hub, Xtreme Tab!

  For PSC, it will auto install with the Xtreme Core Injector!  Be sure to install AutoBleem first!

  For PSC, you can also obtain the N64 mappers Installation from PSC Folder, AB, _km_retroarch_xtreme_n64_remaps
executable, if using other Modifications, such as RetroBoot, etc.  Note, it isn't a true executable!  It is 
merely a specialized self extraction installer!  It may flag some virus protections due to it being such.  But,
it is perfectly harmless, and it is done this way to avoid "read only" issues on installation!  Simply point to
your USB Drive, and let it install!  Note, RetroBoot, and my personalized Injector use the same paths!  So, it
will work perfectly for both upon installation!  Using it elsewhere, you may run into conflicts, due to incorrect
paths.  

  Upon installation for SNES/NES/MD/PSC, simply load any given game.  Then, go into RetroArch Settings, Quick Menu,
Controls, Load Mapper, select from the N64 Xtreme or N64 Ludicrous Folder, whichever mapper applies to your game. 
N64 Xtreme folder will be applicable to GLupeN64, Parallel, Mupen Cores!  N64 Ludicrous will ONLY apply to the
LudicrousN64 Xtreme Core!  I used different mapping systems for each, so they are not directly interchangeable!  
Be sure to use and/or create the mappers using the appropriate Cores to avoid conflicts!

  Stability wise, GLupeN64 is most stable for practical use, followed by Parallel, followed by Mupen, then 
Mupen Next/Xtreme.  Unfortunately, due to GLES Video Conflicts, you will get glitches in many games, when
running with Mupen Next/Xtreme!  This may potentially be able to be fixed up in future Releases!  More
details of the specifics of any given Core for MD/SNES/NES/PSC, N64, or any other system...wise, feel
free to ask me personally, and/or pay attention to most current Release Notes, my YouTube Videos, etc!

    Now, then, let's get started on Nintendo 64 Mapping for those of you unassociated with how Axis work
on controllers!  We will do a little bit of association, with video games, to make it as effortless as
possible!  In any case!:

  There are 4 Axis you will have to contend with, Y-, Y+, X+, X-  These can be quite confusing!  BUT, if you
look at them another way!  

Y- = Think of the Y as someone standing up, like he is about to jump out of a plane, and go skydiving!
The - is what platform, at the edge of the plane that he stands on, before he jumps out of said plane!

Y+ = This man is now spiraling out of control, since he didn't quite jump smoothly from the plane!
The + is him spinning around as he plummets towards the ground!  Luckily, before he hits the ground...

X- = Comes along, this being Simon Belmont, of all people...
The - is his extended arm, before he throws the X, which is the Boomerang!  

X+ = The Boomerang is now thrown, and spinning as it goes, hence...
The + is the Boomerang following its path!  Luckily, with the sheer power and force and determination
of Simon Belmont's Legacy, he has safely stopped the Man who had earlier jumped from the plane, from
his almost inevitable demise!

The L and R, Z, B and A Buttons are self explanatory, and can be applied at face value.  But, the trickier ones:

These 4 Axis can be applied to 3 places!

D Pad =

Y- = Up
Y+ = Down
X- = Left
X+ = Right

Analog = 

Y- = Up
Y+ = Down
X- = Left
X+ - Right

Yellow C Buttons = 

Y- = C Up
Y+ = C Down
X- = C Left
X+ = C Right

Of course, you can apply the C Buttons to an analog stick, if you so choose to!  You can map these games
a myriad of different ways!

After you create any given mapper on whichever game, go to RetroArch Settings, Controls, Save Game Mapper!
This will then be utilized on the Next Load of that specific game!  If you want to delete it, simply use
the option to Delete Game Mapper!  

PS, be sure to let me know of any games that you see that might benefit Mapping Fix Ups, and I will do
what I can in future, concurrent Releases, to account for that!  And, I will be doing these Mappers for
any other Cores that are more convenient for those of you who do not have easy access to analog controllers!

Enjoy, KMFDManic!
