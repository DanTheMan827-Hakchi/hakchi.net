This module will add support for TRUE MT-32 sound!

In order for this to work MT32_PCM.ROM and MT32_CONTROL.ROM bios are needed.  Place them both in
retroarch/system/Scummvm folder.

  If you experience issues, simply install Default ScummVM Injector:)

--

Enjoy your ScummVM games, such as Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Day of the Tentacle,
and many more...
in an entirely new light, with a far more robust sound quality!  Not to mention, drum effects!

  MUNT is an MT-32
Emulator for ScummVM which now is currently functional!  

Whichever of the RetroArch ScummVM Midi HMODs is installed
"last" will take precedence over the former.  

Reinstalling RetroArch Xtreme will revert to "standard" ScummVM sound. 
You can, alternately, go into ScummVM 
Settings, while a game is currently loaded within the Core...and, select 
either/or, of whichever is installed.  
You can, additionally, install the RetroArch ScummVM Default Sound HMOD
to revert to a per norm situation.
