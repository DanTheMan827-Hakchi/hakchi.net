We now have amazing DraStic running on the PSC!  Personal thanks to the efforts of
MMC and genderbent...and, of course, the original author Exophase...and, ANYONE who
has ever worked on the emulator!  I, KMFDManic, updated the cheats to more Xtreme proportions:)
I will optimize things more in future Updates!

**All of the following go to "root" of the flash/hard drive you are planning on using!**

1. Install AutoBleem Modification
2. Install _km_psc_xtreme_core_injector_autobleem (overwrite anything it asks!)
3. Install _km_psc_drastic_core_injector_autobleem (if you want DraStic!)

Upon first boot DraStic will install, then reboot:)  It will be accessible via Load Core/Games!

Sincerely, KMFDManic:)
