Thanks to Ajembo and the DevilutionX Team for all their dedication to the Open Source Implementation of Diablo, 
as well as all of the original people behind the initial project!

Personal thanks to genderbent for his amazing contributions to RetroBoot!

Thanks bslenul and madmonkey for helping on MD/SNES/NES side of things; notv37 on the PSC front!

Lastly, thanks to gameseeker86 for reaching out to Ajembo and getting things started!

This is a nice method of installing APPS for usage with my Xtreme Injector Set-Up! 

And, thank all who have worked on the original Games that these boot!

1. Extract to main of Flash/Hard Drive

2. On Boot, RetroBoot Installer will Activate!

3. You will need to provide the legal files for whichever games, of which we 
cannot share!

IE: For DevilutionX, you will need to copy diabdat.mpq from Official Diablo (GOG Version Works!)

More will be added in the future!

KMFDManic!
