**NOTE** 

**If you don't use AutoBleem, anything I post non-related to AutoBleem, will be ONLY
on my Google Drive, henceforth...so as to keep a nice median for overall Release Size!

As of 4-1-19, the Xtreme Core Set Injector now has Compression Support.  
Install AutoBleem Beta, THEN the Injector, and let everything overwrite.  If you 
already have AutoBleem installed, simply skip that step!Use whichever injector 
applies to you for Cheats, and/or Cores:)  

KMFDManic, Here!  This is the Cliff Notes Version of how to utilize this set-up!

**It is highly recommended to run with a Powered USB-HUB, to counteract the 
limiter that is in the PS Classic...that prevents too much power draw!**

**But, most things will run fine, on a 16 GB or less Flash Drive, in port 2...
And, controller in Port 1.**

*32 GB and larger flash/hard drives...might draw just a little too much power.
These are cases where a HUB is most certainly a welcome addition!**

1. Install AutoBleem

2. If you've already used either, delete cores/info folders, entirely.

3. Extract _km_psc_xtreme_core_set_injector to Flash Drive

4. Be sure to let it overwrite all files that it prompts to!

5. To install BIOS, navigate to retroarch/system:)

6. C2, C3, C4, C5, C7, C8 errors will not prompt on screen.
Instead, your system will simply and gracefully shut down, or
kick you back to the main Modification Splash Screen!

7. If, by chance, you do run into something that gets stuck...
And, you have no choice but to pull power plug...make sure you
do a disk check on your PC, before running it again.  I would
suggest being patient for a minute or two, first, however...
as you may find it will eventually exit/load/etc!  

8. When done, RetroArch Exit shuts system down safely, or
sends you back to Splash Screen depending on whichever
Modification you are using.

9. Have fun!

Sincerely, KMFDManic!

Personal thanks to everyone for their efforts in the PS Classic
Scene!  Things will continue to get better and better, without a doubt!
