Hello, hope you all get to enjoy the fantastic PS Classic Xtreme Core Set Release!  This is especially meant to 
be for those who have been enjoying my Mini NES/SNES Release for the last 2 years+  I did what I could to make
the transition as easy and optimal and awesome as possible!

Personal thanks to CompCom, Swingflip, DoctorDalek, Yannick, screemerpl, and everyone else for their efforts in the PS Classic
Scene!  Things will continue to get better and better, without a doubt!

**Instructions for installation**

in Xtras/PS Classic, are the essential Tools, Information, etc, you will need to get started!  AutoBleem will be the
primary option to start with.  You will also find in there, the "_km_psc_xtreme_core & cheat_injectors"!  Simply run whichever
applies to you.  And, point it/them to your Flash Drive!  All will be installed RetroArch, Xtreme Cores, and so on!  If it
prompts to overwrite any existing files, on installation, confirm YES...and, allow it to do so.  

Main Release will be consistently updated with other nifty things, inside PS CLASSIC folder.  

Tools that you can utilize for Mini NES/SNES/PSC, are in Xtras/Tools, PS1!

**Write-Up from my concurrent Release Notes, related to me starting PS Classic Support with this and
my future Core Set Releases!**

First of all, thanks to all of you, 500 plus total...that have continually been persistent about me getting onto the PS Classic!
I have been sick with light pneumonia for nearly a month, which threw things off a bit!  Plus a few other fun factors, such as
-20 windchill temperatures, 70+ MPH windstorms, as seen in my Viral Video from last Release, and so on!  But, I am back now, in
nearly full force...as seen with the last two Updates!  This time around, not only will get an Update for the NES/SNES Classics...
but, also the PS Classic!  Full Speed Ahead...Xtreme Mode Activate!...err BEAST Mode Activate!!!

What many of you might not have realized from the last few Updates, is that many of the changes were done in such fashion to 
directly correlate to compatibility, performance, and speed...for not only the Mini NES/SNES...but, also the PS Classic! 
A lot of testing and multiple builds were done to try to arrive at the best possible end results for all Systems involved.
I give huge personal thanks to Dank Games, DRVR 99, Gravy, for helping stress test many perimeters, to give me a beneficial 
2nd, 3rd, 4th opinion, and so on!  It all worked out for the best!

I have pretty much been working on this side project Release since January, when and where I could.  I am happy to now bring it on and 
share it with all of you who have been following me for the last 2 years in the Mini Scene...as well as newcomers alike.

I found it nearly of epic and absurd proportions, how many immediately latched onto the bandwagon of giving the PS Classic abnormally
bad reviews.  I stated months ago, it would be a Modder's Paradise.  This is beyond 110 percent true, at this point!  As a vanilla
system, yes, things are arguable.  But, pretty much everyone and their mother and their father and their brother and their dog and so
on...just had to critically bash the poor machine.  Yes, Sony had a few missteps with their overall Release, from the sorry line-up of
games, to going the easier route of PCSX ReArmed, default emulator...versus the tried and true, fan favorite, POPS...which even I, myself,
personally loved on my PSP and PS3, and so on!  

How many of you have seen a movie that had gotten really awful Critic Reviews, but really loved it, regardless!?  Notable examples for me
would be Super Troopers, The Last Dragon (Not "that" Bruce Lee!), The Sandlot, Spaceballs, Step Brothers, Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, Tango &
Cash, not to mention...many Troma Films, Trey Parker and Matt Stone's failed live action efforts Basketball and Orgazmo.  I can list off
a multitude of movies, as I am pretty sure all of you can, as well.  Never let the naysayers and critics sway you, one way or another.
Most of you had an inkling you would want a PS Classic for potential modding purposes!  But, several of you have already told me, in 
conversations, that you didn't get one...or, even canceled preorders, due to these horrid reviews!

Fact remains, as you will see with This Release, the PS Classic is pretty much a Beast, in many respects!  You will get Full Speed Ahead 
with this Core Set Update, and really and honestly and truly be able to better enjoy your overall nostalgic gaming experience!  MAME 2003
Xtreme, will net you 25-33 percent nominal gains over an unfactored in, two years ago, MAME 2003 Standard Core on the NES/SNES Classic!
With the last Updates, and MAME 2003 Xtreme, particularly...even NES/SNES Classic gains 10-15 percent in improvements, performance and
speed wise.  These changes, while grueling to test, worked out well beyond my expectations.  

Sega System 32 games are near flawless on Mini NES/SNES/PS Classic, now!  And, the stubborn ones, such as Alien 3: The Gun, Outrunners, 
Jurassic Park, while running well enough to be enjoyable on NES/SNES, run pretty spectacularly on the PSC!  

Run and Gun, a very tough to run game, which markwkidd helped me get bootstrapped in for the Mini NES/SNES, awhile back, performs 
exceedingly well on the PSC, with the changes in place!

Taito F3 Games run way better on PSC, such as Grid Seeker, Gekirandan (Now, it really does feel like you are playing a Sega Saturn Game,
Full Speed Ahead, on your PSC!)

You will see me showcase many games in the below Videos!  Games you have previously deemed stubborn, definitely try out, again...on the
new Core Set Release!  You might be thoroughly surprised at some of the results!  Several of these changes, that contribute to the better
performance/speed/pure awesomeness, have been rolling out over my last few Updates!  Quite a bit of collaboration, testing, and all that 
jazz, had been going on behind the scenes.  We are finally there, Guys and Gals!  Now then...

Buying a PS Classic is an absolute given for any serious or casual Modding Enthusiast, bar none!  But, there are most definitely several 
nuances to adjust to!  I will cover some of these in videos and future Release Notes, of course!  For now, if you are "on the fence", so
to speak...as far as even considering buying one...definitely check out the videos and you will see some of the incredible feats and 
accomplishments the little PS Classic Beast is capable of!  Beast Mode Activate!

The NES/SNES Minis are very well made, have 2 solid years of Modding Ingenuity behind them, have most potential issues sorted, and are 
quite reliable as far as doing what you want them to do!  There is still a bit of room for more fun and improvement.  I will keep on 
keeping on with Releases related to them both.  

The PS Classic is still in its infant stage.  Although it has better hardware specs, and can really be on the lines of, as I mentioned, 
"Beast Mode Activate"...with this current Core Set Release...It definitely has its share of issues to contend with, such as a generally
steep learning curve, a ton of room for Modding Improvement, minor power fallacies which will improve after time.  

I personally love having both, NES/SNES, as well as PS Classic.  They have enough perks to warrant purchase of both, or all 3!  You can 
run most stuff, absolutely fine, with my Xtreme Core Set and RetroArch Xtreme, on Mini NES/SNES.  But, PS Classic, with my Core Set for
that, better excels with PSP/Dreamcast/Amiga, and other generally stubborn Cores!  But, unfortunately, ones that have dynamic recompiler 
issues, are negligible as far as improvement.  These would be PCSX ReArmed, which runs only a tad better; 4DO, Yabause, BSNES, PC-FX, and
a select few others.  These simply will not be any better unless some more comprehensive work is done.


**Yabause Fixed:)**

As mentioned previously, Yabause has issues with properly hooking up to Dynamic Recompiler.  So, until that is worked out, the Core is
more of a gimmick than anything to take seriously!  I will keep you posted if anything changes.  Kronos is our other alternative, which 
might be able to be gotten working, as well!

For now, more Cores and such work on Mini NES/SNES, than on PS Classic.  That could change, in the future.  I will work on getting more 
to be compatible, of the ones that don't currently work.  These will roll out in future Releases.  

I will not, at all, play any favoritism.  But, I did not feel comfortable enough recommending any specific Modding Solution, a few months
ago.  There simply were some factors that needed a little time to adjust to, before I could comfortably decree any of them safe.  This,
being aside from the PSpwned, that I showcased a little while back!

Bleemsync (Pat Hartl) and Autobleem (screemerpl) are the two primary, current, go to Modding Outlets to get the "hacks" in place, right
now.  Both are excellent options, with their own set of nuances and learning curves.  As mentioned in the previous Release, we are 
essentially on a Final Frontier, where no man/woman has quite gone before.  I would best recommend being very patient with those who 
actively work on these modifications.  Avoid getting worked up, frustrated, angry, because things don't work or go the way you want them to.  

Most of us in the Modding, or any scene, for that matter...do this stuff so others, like yourselves, can enjoy it!  Many of us have
Day/Night Jobs, and this is a hobbyist thing!  So, take things with a grain of salt, before you start dragging your heart around!

in Xtras/PS Classic, are the essential Tools, Information, etc, you will need to get started!  BleemSync/AutoBleem will be your two 
options to start with.  You will also find in there, the "_km_psc_xtreme_core_set_injector"!  Simply run it.  And, point it to your
Flash Drive!  If using AutoBleem, just install directly to flash drive, as is!  If BleemSync, navigate the installation to be at
bleemsync/opt/  It will install all you need regarding RetroArch, Xtreme Cores, and so on!  If it prompts to overwrite any existing 
files, on installation, confirm YES...and, allow it to do so.

There is a truly delicate balance between power consumption and performance and overall stability.  Assuming you are running the main 
PS Classic, with just a standard flash drive in Controller USB Port number 2, with an equivalent to Mini NES/SNES USB Power Source...
RetroArch and some Cores can run into a few snags, which can lead to inevitably crashing your system to a shut-down.  We will try to 
iron some of these out.  Myself and a few others have very carefully and painstaking tested power/performance differentials out, 
accordingly.  And, I have arrived at a simple, yet elegant, solution...as you will see when you run RetroArch!  Many stress tests 
have been done, with higher cpu/gpu intensive Cores passing with flying Colors, with the current state of my Release.  Most standard 
USB Chargers, with at least 5 volts and 1 amp, will work fine...in the finished product!

I am going to maintain things in a way, so that previous Users of NESC/SNESC may more easily acclimate to the PS Classic.  There are
obviously going to be a few nuances to adjust to, accordingly.  But, that was pretty much a given, from the start!  The _DUMMY Folder
Method I outlined in a ton of my videos, is the primary way of running games on PSC, for now.  I have always been very partial to this
method on the Mini NES/SNES!  It is nice, easy, very convenient.  It is no different on PSC.  Simply Click Load Core, Load Content,
navigate to MEDIA, then the directory of your choosing.  I personally just toss a _DUMMY Folder into the outset of the drive!

Sincerely, KMFDManic!  Thanks for reading!
