Hello PSC Users!  KMFDManic here, with a very brief written tutorial on running OpenBOR.  History below said write-up!

OpenBOR Game/s are in _km_Xtras/Games/OpenBOR in Release, as well as Mega NZ Link.  I may update more in future Releases!
You can, additionally, find them online.

You have 2 current options to run OpenBOR games.  A 3rd Option will likely make it to PSC, in the future.  For 
now, it is more optimal for usage on the NESC/SNESC.

If you load a game and it emits an error message or crashes, it is very likely not supported.

DOS (Full Speed), which equates to games that were made around 2004.  These
games will run full speed ahead, with minor hiccups due to slight timing offsets.  These are mostly negligible.
Simply copy a Pak file into OpenBOR_DOS Template Folder (Yes, the folder can be renamed). The Pak file must be
renamed, exactly as BOR.PAK or it will not work.

PSP (Slow to Moderate Speed), which relates to games from 2004 and on, til roughly the year 2011.  These games
will vary in terms of performance and speed, some running better than others.  Halloween: Wrath of Michael Meyers
is an example of one that runs pretty top notch.  Final Fight Gold CE is a little sluggish.  But, it is still
quite playable!  Copy Pak into Paks folder.  This will not need renamed like the DOS one.  It will work, as is,
as long as it is the only Pak in said folder.  If you attempt to put more than one in Paks folder, it will not 
auto load.  It will, instead, do a menu prompt.  Then, you'd have to choose the pak.  Personally, I do one 
game per template, as I much prefer the auto load method!

OpenBOR_DOS

Run OpenBOR_DOS, bor.exe, with DOSBox-SVN, BOR.PAK, if it exists and is supported, will auto load.

OpenBOR_PSP  

Run OpenBOR_PSP, EBOOT.PBP, with PPSSPP Xtreme, Pak file, if present in paks folder, will auto load.

**What is OpenBOR?**

Beats of Rage is an open-source 2D customisable video game engine designed by Senile Team and inspired by
Sega's classic Streets of Rage series of beat'em up games. It was initially released as a video game tribute
for Streets of Rage 2 with characters from The King of Fighters.

**Development and release**

Beats of Rage took nine months to develop.[1][2] The game was then modded and ported to other systems, resulting
in increased popularity. More than a million copies of the game were downloaded.[1]

Beats of Rage was first made available for DOS in November 2003.[3] Despite only word-of-mouth advertising, the 
game quickly gained popularity, taking down mirror hosts such as Dreamcast-Scene only 24 hours after agreeing to host it.[4][5]

As the game was open source, it was ported to Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. It has continued to receive ports, as it is
available on contemporary systems including Wii and PlayStation Portable as well as several other platforms.

For a homebrew game, Beats of Rage received significant mainstream media attention, being highlighted in gaming 
magazine G4.[6] The game was also featured in printed media such as XboxGamer.[7]
